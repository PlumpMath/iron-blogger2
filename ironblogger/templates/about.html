<h1>About Iron Blogger</h1>

<p>Iron Blogger is a friendly little game people use to get themselves to blog
more. The software that runs this website is free and open source; you can get
the code <a href="https://github.com/zenhack/iron-blogger2">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Rules: Summary</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Post once a week.</li>
	<li>If you don't turn in a post, you owe $5.</li>
	<li>If you turn in a post late, you owe $1 for each week that it's late
		(max $5)</li>
	<li>You can't owe more than $30.</li>
	<li>We'll spend the money on parties for everyone! afterwards, all the
		accounting resets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pedantic Details</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Each participant is expected to publish one blog post per week.</li>
	<li>If a participant misses a post, they owe $5.00 for that post.</li>
	<li>If a participant posts more than once in a given week, subsequent posts
		will reduce the debt incurred by any posts the participant had previously
		missed.</li>
	<li>We will periodically have parties funded from the debt people incurr.
		After the party (and once debts have been paid), the accounting resets.</li>
	<li>No participant shall owe more than $30.00 per party.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding the last bullet point: When a participant publishes an extra post, it
counts as the most recent post that the participant has missed. Rather than
owing $5.00 for that post, the participant will owe $N, where the post is N
weeks (rounded up) late, provided N is less than 5.</p>

<p>As an example, if during a seven week period, Alice does not post for the
first six weeks, and then starts posting, the following table shows the details
of how much she owes and for what (based on how many times she posts in week
seven).</p>

<table class="table">
	<tr>
		<th>Week 1</th>
		<th>Week 2</th>
		<th>Week 3</th>
		<th>Week 4</th>
		<th>Week 5</th>
		<th>Week 6</th>
		<th>Week 7 (current)</th>
		<th>Posts in week 7</th>
		<th>Owed</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>

	</tr>
</table>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In the first row, Alice only owes $30, not $35, even though
		7 posts * $5 = $35; the debt cap prevents her from exceeding $30.</li>
	<li>In the last row, Alice turns a post in for week 2, but it is so late that
		she doesn't get any credit.</li>
</ul>
