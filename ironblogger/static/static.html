	<section>
		<p>The <a href="http://beta.openaerialmap.org/">OpenAerialMap Beta</a> was just <a href="https://developmentseed.org/blog/2015/05/27/introducing-openaerialmap/">launched yesterday</a> by DevelopmentSeed - a reboot of the old OAM from ~2008 (if I recall?). It's a global index of aerial imagery, depending on a simple standard for metadata which we now plan to support in Public Lab's MapKnitter:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/178">https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/178</a></p>

<p>Many of the maps in it have ~50cm/px resolution, whereas many MapKnitter maps (made from balloon, kite, and drone imagery) have 5-15cm/px resolution. And there are a lot of MapKnitter maps -- 1578 as of today.</p>

<h3 id="Georectification+metadata">Georectification metadata</h3>

<p>I have another suggestion, though -- what if we modularized by providing georeferencing in aerial image metadata? (I know, isn't this what a GeoTiff is? :-P) There are a few reasons that'd be a good idea for individual images. First, MapKnitter approaches the problem from the other end of things when compared to auto-stitching. Instead of batch-processing huge numbers of images (which can take hours), Public Lab mappers fly balloons or kites much higher than drones typically can -- 1000-4000 feet, and capture fewer, large images. A good image from up high can cover a quarter mile! But in any case, many people just need a single good shot, like <a href="http://mapknitter.org/maps/puerta-del-sol-madrid-17-mayo-2015">this one by Pablo Rey in Madrid</a>:</p>




<p>This means that referencing is pretty easy to do by hand - just upload the image, scale and rotate it into place. Or if your camera/smartphone has a GPS, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/plots-dev/1MqyjEQEpYc">MapKnitter will auto-place the image for you</a>, using <strong>GPS, GPS altitude, and compass heading</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="Skipping+re-rasterization">Skipping re-rasterization</h3>

<p>The other side of this is that due to our recently launched Leaflet plugin <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/">Leaflet.DistortableImage</a> (read a <em>great</em> in-depth discussion in <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/justinmanley">@justinmanley</a>'s <a href="http://publiclab.org/notes/justinmanley/05-21-2015/the-magic-behind-mapknitter-leaflet-distortableimage">The Magic Behind MapKnitter</a>), MapKnitter 2.0 displays georectified images <strong>natively distorted with CSS3</strong>, in the browser. Go ahead -- right click the image above, and open it in a new tab. <strong>It's not a tile layer.</strong></p>

<p>This means that unless you want to print a map out, there's no longer a reason to run GDAL (which powers MapKnitter's exporting function) at all -- hundreds of images are simply rotated, scaled, distorted, and displayed in real-time. For huge batches of images, we'd prefer to simply store each image once, which also means that you don't have to lose data where images overlap -- say, if one has better exposure, but the other has better sharpness. Most of all, it means MapKnitter's exporting engine doesn't need to be fired up as often -- saving CPU and memory on our servers. For big maps like <a href="http://mapknitter.org/maps/lincoln-peak-vineyard">this 48-image map by Chris Fastie</a>, that makes a big difference:</p>




<p>These aren't everyone's priorities -- they're distinct to our use case -- but there is a common thread. We've kept an eye on auto-stitching approaches such as what <a href="https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/OpenDroneMap">OpenDroneMap</a> is finally making easier. But it's not an either-or situation. We feel that the ease (especially for non-programmers, or non-GIS folks) of simply placing an image on a map makes a huge difference for many folks. But a rough placement can make interest point matching much more efficient, and some automation (such as via GPS) can make manual stitching much more efficient.</p>

<h3 id="Convergence">Convergence</h3>

<p>Let's converge by standardizing on the interchange format of the rectification data itself, so that images from MapKnitter can be used as an incoming dataset for OpenDroneMap, and eventually, we could use interest point matching to assist manual stitching -- perhaps by providing visual indications of possible matches, like semi-transparent "spiderwebs" connecting two nearby images.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/088/original/Screen_Shot_2015-05-29_at_11.05.26_AM.png"><img alt="Screen_Shot_2015-05-29_at_11.05.26_AM.png" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/088/medium/Screen_Shot_2015-05-29_at_11.05.26_AM.png" /></a></p>

<p>Just to throw out one more wild idea here -- I believe the matrix distortion calculations we do for Leaflet.DistortableImage could be re-used in WebGL to (someday?) generate exportable full-resolution versions of maps, in the browser. If possible, that would make this type of mapmaking hugely scalable!</p>

	<section>
		<p>This test is nowhere near as comprehensive as the big one we did at LEAFFEST a few years ago, but I wanted to know if we could switch Infragram Webcams to red filters as we've begun to do with other Infragram conversions. I set up one of each and ran it through a couple test scenarios, but I'd like to ask folks input on if this seems to be working.</p>

<p>The first is of a bed of weeds in a nearby park. Running with the preset for blue filters, colorized NDVI:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/023/original/2015-05-27T19_39_58.552Z.jpg"><img alt="2015-05-27T19_39_58.552Z.jpg" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/023/medium/2015-05-27T19_39_58.552Z.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>And same but with the red filtered camera, with the red filter preset:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/024/original/2015-05-27T19_39_55.170Z.jpg"><img alt="2015-05-27T19_39_55.170Z.jpg" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/024/medium/2015-05-27T19_39_55.170Z.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>The original image is:</p>

</ul>


<hr />

<p>I did a second test of a potted houseplant on my back porch:</p>

<p>Blue filter:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/025/original/2015-05-27T19_42_55.993Z.jpg"><img alt="2015-05-27T19_42_55.993Z.jpg" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/025/medium/2015-05-27T19_42_55.993Z.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Red filter:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/026/original/2015-05-27T19_42_59.348Z.jpg"><img alt="2015-05-27T19_42_59.348Z.jpg" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/010/026/medium/2015-05-27T19_42_59.348Z.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Infragram links here:</p>

<p>Blue: <a href="http://infragram.org/i/556618eafed547da29000061">http://infragram.org/i/556618eafed547da29000061</a>
Red: <a href="http://infragram.org/i/55661939fed547da29000062">http://infragram.org/i/55661939fed547da29000062</a></p>

<hr />

<p>One thing I immediately notice is that for areas with low dynamic range data, in dark regions like shadows, the blue filter technique returns lots of artificially inflated values (red artifacts) which likely aren't really high productivity zones, but just noise. The red filter technique does not cause this effect.</p>

<p>It does seem like the red filter version can work with this webcam. But I'd like to hear from others to get consensus.</p>

	<section>
		<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/37c38l/uefi_backdoor_allows_root_exploit_in_linux/">This</a> is currently the top story on the Linux subreddit. It links to <a href="https://twitter.com/d_olex/status/602823348272246785/">this Tweet</a> which demonstrates using a System Management Mode backdoor to perform privilege escalation under Linux. This is not a story.<br /><br />But first, some background. System Management Mode (SMM) is a feature in most x86 processors since the 386SL back in 1990. It allows for certain events to cause the CPU to stop executing the OS, jump to an area of hidden RAM and execute code there instead, and then hand off back to the OS without the OS knowing what just happened. This allows you to do things like hardware emulation (SMM is used to make USB keyboards look like PS/2 keyboards before the OS loads a USB driver), fan control (SMM will run even if the OS has crashed and lets you avoid the cost of an additional chip to turn the fan on and off) or even more complicated power management (some server vendors use SMM to read performance counters in the CPU and adjust the memory and CPU clocks without the OS interfering).<br /><br />In summary, SMM is a way to run a bunch of non-free code that probably does a worse job than your OS does in most cases, but is occasionally helpful (it's how your laptop prevents random userspace from overwriting your firmware, for instance). And since the RAM that contains the SMM code is hidden from the OS, there's no way to audit what it does. Unsurprisingly, it's an interesting vector to insert malware into - you could configure it so that a process can trigger SMM and then have the resulting SMM code find that process's credentials structure and change it so it's running as root.<br /><br />And that's what Dmytro has done - he's written code that sits in that hidden area of RAM and can be triggered to modify the state of the running OS. But he's modified his own firmware in order to do that, which isn't something that's possible without finding an existing vulnerability in either the OS or (or more recently, <em>and</em>) the firmware. It's an excellent demonstration that what we knew to be theoretically possible is practically possible, but it's not evidence of such a backdoor being widely deployed.<br /><br />What would that evidence look like? It's more difficult to analyse binary code than source, but it would still be possible to trace firmware to observe everything that's dropped into the SMM RAM area and pull it apart. Sufficiently subtle backdoors would still be hard to find, but enough effort would probably uncover them. A PC motherboard vendor managed to leave the source code to their firmware on an open FTP server and copies leaked into the wild - if there's a ubiquitous backdoor, we'd expect to see it there.<br /><br />But still, the fact that system firmware is mostly entirely closed is still a problem in engendering trust - the means to inspect large quantities binary code for vulnerabilities is still beyond the vast majority of skilled developers, let alone the average user. Free firmware such as Coreboot gets part way to solving this but still doesn't solve the case of the pre-flashed firmware being backdoored and then installing the backdoor into any new firmware you flash.<br /><br />This specific case may be based on a misunderstanding of Dmytro's work, but figuring out ways to make it easier for users to trust that their firmware is tamper free is going to be increasingly important over the next few years. I have some ideas in that area and I hope to have them working in the near future.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=35110" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

	<section>
		<p>I've been curious about how little helium it'd take to lift a Möbius camera as we've been using for our <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/wiki/infragram">Infragram Point and Shoot cams</a>.</p>

<p>We pay around $30 for the balloons in the balloon mapping kit, and helium can be $30-50 per flight, or worse in some places. So the ~$65 Möbius cam, which weighs about 38 grams, opens up some possibilities for us, compared to the 200-250g Canon Powershots we often use.</p>

<p>18 inch Mylar balloons are less than a dollar apiece, and the above pictured 3 foot balloon is well under $10. I think we can get the 3 foot latex balloons for ~$3 each. The nice thing about Mylar is that it can remain inflated for a couple weeks, and either of these fits in a car or on the subway! So flights over multiple days are much easier, and instead of buying or moving a helium tank, you can fill these at a florist or party store.</p>

<p>Anyhow the above test worked -- it lifts the Möbius easily! And I have ordered some 18 inch mylar balloons to test too.</p>

	<section>
		<p>Welcome to the 2nd monthly Web Working Group report! I'm going to try to write faster this time; last month's took 3 hours to compile, and I want to do this every month if possible. Big picture, our focus was MapKnitter Annotations 2.0, wrapping up MapKnitter 2.0 changes and debugging as much as possible, and trying to get started on Spectral Workbench 2.0. That last goal didn't see too much progress yet, as things were quite busy.</p>

<p>Above, just as a treat, I've posted <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/graphs/punch-card">Github's graph</a> of <em>when in the week work gets done</em> for the history of the Plots2 project. Neat visualization!</p>

<p>This month the PL staff retreat took a week out of the middle of development for me personally, but we still got a lot done. Main Milestones show as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>parts of <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/milestones/2.0%20launch">Spectral Workbench 2.0</a> (7 of 58 issues done... ug)</li>
<li>parts of the <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/milestones/Graphing%20design%20overhaul">Spectral Workbench graphing system</a> (9 open issues, same as last month)</li>
<li>parts of <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/milestones/2.1%20release">MapKnitter 2.1</a> (27 open issues, 12 closed)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Issue+reporting+and+non-coder+contributions">Issue reporting and non-coder contributions</h3>

<p>We've made a push to streamline the issue reporting process, and to emphasize the central role bug and feature reports have in developing Public Lab software. Importantly, this is a role that can be fulfilled by non-coders! See especially the <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/wiki/issues#What+to+report">What to Report section</a> of the newly updated Issues page.</p>

<p>As always, thanks for all the input and feedback -- not to mention testing -- from community members! As I mentioned last month, if you'd like to bump up or request priority for a feature or bug, please feel free to leave a comment here and we'll see what we can do. For a more complete look at our planned work in the next month, <a href="https://waffle.io/publiclab/plots2">check out the Waffle.io board</a> in the Ready column. The Priority column includes tasks we're still gathering information for, and/or looking to fit into our schedule, in part due to grant support.</p>

<h3 id="Spectral+Workbench">Spectral Workbench</h3>

<p>Much less progress was made on Spectral Workbench, in part due to the staff retreat, slower than expected progress on MapKnitter Annotations 2.0, and other projects. Only one issue was closed, and <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/issues/81">it was actually fixed a while ago</a>. Still, only two new issues were opened, and work will probably begin soon on auto-calibration and the graphing system overhaul. Read more in <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pulse/monthly">Github Pulse</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Plots2+(PublicLab.org)">Plots2 (PublicLab.org)</h3>

<p>Between issue cleanup and some hard work early in the month, a LOT has been done on the Plots2 codebase; a total of 25 issues were closed by <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/btbonval">@btbonval</a> and myself, and 8 issues were opened by 3 people -- real quantitative progress vs. last month! :-P</p>

<p>We launched a new "Features" system which moved many temporary content features such as banners and the 5th year anniversary top bar into a database-backed editor which site admins can change without rolling out new code. This has lightened the codebase, almost eliminated content-based commits, and set us up for a possible "de-branding" of the site to make it easier for communities besides Public Lab to use the Plots2 software. We do need to add template caching to this Features system to tamp down database calls and memory use, however.</p>

<p>Notable changes also include a new <a href="http://publiclab.org/people">http://publiclab.org/people</a> listing, a login interface revamp, and a major optimization to tag lookups (under the hood) which has lowered our memory footprint.

	<section>
		<h1 id="a-mozilla-developer-institute">A Mozilla Developer Institute</h1>

<p><em>TL;DR - Why Mozilla should create an Mozilla Developer Institute in order to train the next generation of technology inventors. And how Mozilla could do this by building on existing resources.</em> </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, Mark blogged about a concept called <a href="https://commonspace.wordpress.com/2015/03/31/building-an-academy/">Mozilla Academy</a> as part of Mozilla’s broader vision. And he asked “What does a Mozilla Academy look like?”</p>

<p>Here is one piece of the answer: </p>

<p>Within the broader Academy framework, Mozilla could launch a Mozilla Developer Institute that provides high-end training for technologists, who will create the open technology infrastructure of the future. </p>

<p>Such an institute would serve an important need. It’s an idea that Mozilla would be well positioned to pursue. And it’s something the MIT Media Lab (where I work) might be able to help with. </p>

<p><strong>Mozilla Institute of Technology</strong></p>

<p>Creating a top training program for technology architects, designers and developers. The Institute is designed for advanced technologists, but all content is shared openly, and learning happens in the open so that others can build on it. </p>

<p>The Institute offers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A better alternative to expensive outdated university programs, or to bootcamp style start-up programs. Graduates will have excellent career prospects. </li>
  <li>A flexible curriculum and format, that emphasizes the broader context of technology design, and adapts to the time and location-preferences of its learners. </li>
  <li>Access to a community of top developers who care about the influence of technology on the world they live in. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hands-on relevant learning, online &amp; offline</strong></p>

<p>Learning doesn’t take place in lectures, but through participation in real meaningful projects, and by working with other developers. </p>

<ul>
  <li>A flexible format, in which students design their own course of study. </li>
  <li>Face-to-face masterclasses, and seminars, offered at Mozilla offices.</li>
  <li>Student work on “real-world” problems, interacting with the Mozilla developer community. Coding challenges offer hard problems to tackle. </li>
  <li>A peer-to-peer learning culture and community. Experienced Mozillians act as mentors and guides.</li>
  <li>An open library of video tutorials, worked examples, and reference documentation for self-study.   </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bootstrapped by building on existing resources</strong></p>

<p>The Institute doesn’t need to be a huge new undertaking. It can get started quickly, by building on the pieces that are already in place.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Knowledge &gt; The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a> has already developed a vast library of reference and learning materials. And it supports an active community of users, some of whom might be interested in helping design (or participate in) the institute. </li>
  <li>People &gt; Tapping into Mozilla’s culture of peer-to-peer learning and open sharing, the institute could quickly launch seminars and mentorship. Mozilla employees and core community members could volunteer as mentors, design coding challenges, and teach master-classes or seminars. </li>
  <li>Spaces &gt; Host face-to-face events at Mozilla offices. As a starting point, the institute could simply offer new programming in existing meeting rooms or conference venues. There is no need to invest in expensive real estate. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Offering a path to careers and impact</strong></p>

<p>Graduates have excellent career prospects, deep technology skills, an amazing network of Mozillians, and a well rounded understanding of the challenges and power of designing technology for millions of users. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Graduates have mastered today’s cutting edge technologies (full-stack web development, mobile, blockchain …)</li>
  <li>Portfolios demonstrate their skills and accomplishments (instead of degrees).</li>
  <li>Job fairs, and internships, offer connections to employers throughout the program. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Over to you &gt; I’d love to get your reactions to the blueprint above. Does this sound like a useful piece of the overall Mozilla Academy? What’s missing? Which parts make sense, which ones need more work?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Background, details, context…</strong> </p>

<p>I am mainly interested in comments and reactions to the above part, but if you’d like to find out more about the background of this idea, why I think it’s important, and why Mozilla could be in a unique position to tackle this problem, feel free to read on. </p>

<p><em>The problem with technology training</em></p>

<p>The way we train technologists today, doesn’t emphasize how broad the impact of their decisions can be on our economy and society. Traditional computer science education as well as the growing number of alternatives, focus on technical skills first (and markets second). </p>

<p>However, as <a href="http://codev2.cc/download+remix/Lessig-Codev2.pdf">Lawrence Lessig has pointed out</a>, the rise of network technology has upended the traditional ways that society organized behaviors: through norms, markets, laws, and architecture (infrastructure). </p>

<p>The ability to shape behavior through technology infrastructure is both uniquely <em>concentrated</em> (a few developers can develop tools that are used by billions of people), and <em>influential</em>: technology can quickly shape new norms (such as widespread file-sharing), create new markets (airbnb), and make it harder to apply existing laws. </p>

<p>Most technology training doesn’t cover this. Not coincidentally, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig">Lessig</a> teaches at Harvard Law School, not in the CS department. </p>

<p><em>Why Mozilla</em>?</p>

<p>Mozilla has always played a unique role at the intersection of technology and society. And Mozilla has directly shaped many of the technologies that allowed people like me to use technology for social good. For example, <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu">the open web created mind-boggling opportunities</a> to increase access to learning and education. </p>

<p>However, with the emergence of mobile technology and silo’ed ecosystems, we risk that today’s technology infrastructure is increasingly being closed off. Leading technologists <a href="https://medium.com/@johnolilly/on-inevitability-pendula-41a5e59c3ba3">shrug it off</a> as an inevitable step in the evolution of technological systems. Others, including Mozilla, are fighting new legislation that would impeded the openness of our infrastructure, and are winning. I think it’s important to preserve the open nature of today’s technology. But it’s equally important to think ahead. </p>

<p>Future technology infrastructure is unlikely to look anything like the web we have today. It might look like <a href="http://bollier.org/blog/blockchain-promising-new-infrastructure-online-commons">the blockchain</a>. Or something else altogether. Whatever it may be, we will need thoughtful technology inventors to be involved in its core development right from the start. </p>

<p>That’s why we need to train a community of technology experts who understand the great influence of their design decisions, and who are excited by the opportunity to use technology to create a better world. </p>

<p><em>How a Developer Institute would support Mozilla’s mission</em></p>

<p>Given Mozilla’s mission to keep the web open, it can pull different levers to achieve this. One lever is a community of innovators, whose work demonstrates the social value of having an open infrastructure. They “wield the web” to build better election systems, better newspapers, and better ways to do science. Another lever is a mass movement of people who are informed users, to the point, where they care about the openness of the web and would contribute in political action to stop initiatives like SOPA. Mozilla is already doing good work in both of these areas. </p>

<p>The third lever is the space that the Mozilla Institute would focus on. It’s the small group of engineers who are designing and building the technology that the “wielders” and “users” will have at their disposal.</p>

	<h1>2015-04-27 19:33:44: <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/34868.html">Reducing power consumption on Haswell and Broadwell systems</a> by mjg59 via <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/">Matthew Garrett</a></h1>
	<section>
		Edit to add: These patches on their own won't enable this functionality, they just give us a better set of options. Once they're merged we can look at changing the defaults so people get the benefit of this out of the box.<br /><br />Haswell and Broadwell (Intel's previous and current generations of x86) both introduced a range of new power saving states that promised significant improvements in battery life. Unfortunately, the typical experience on Linux was an increase in power consumption. The reasons why are kind of complicated and distinctly unfortunate, and I'm at something of a loss as to why none of the companies who get paid to care about this kind of thing seemed to actually be caring until I got a Broadwell and looked unhappy, but here we are so let's make things better.<br /><br />Recent Intel mobile parts have the Platform Controller Hub (Intel's term for the Southbridge, the chipset component responsible for most system i/o like SATA and USB) integrated onto the same package as the CPU. This makes it easier to implement aggressive power saving - the CPU package already has a bunch of hardware for turning various clock and power domains on and off, and these can be shared between the CPU, the GPU and the PCH. But that also introduces additional constraints, since if any component within a power management domain is active then the entire domain has to be enabled. We've pretty much been ignoring that.<br /><br />The tldr is that Haswell and Broadwell are only able to get into deeper package power saving states if several different components are in their own power saving states. If the CPU is active, you'll stay in a higher-power state. If the GPU is active, you'll stay in a higher-power state. And if the PCH is active, you'll stay in a higher-power state. The last one is the killer here. Having a SATA link in a full-power state is sufficient to keep the PCH active, and that constrains the deepest package power savings state you can enter.<br /><br />SATA power management on Linux is in a kind of odd state. We support it, but we don't enable it by default. In fact, right now we even remove any existing SATA power management configuration that the firmware has initialised. Distributions don't enable it by default because there are horror stories about some combinations of disk and controller and power management configuration resulting in corruption and data loss and apparently nobody had time to investigate the problem.<br /><br />I did some digging and it turns out that our approach isn't entirely inconsistent with the industry. The default behaviour on Windows is pretty much the same as ours. But vendors don't tend to ship with the Windows AHCI driver, they replace it with the Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver - and it turns out that that <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/reference-guide/sata-devices-implementation-recommendations.pdf">has a default-on</a> policy. But to make things even more awkwad, the policy implemented by Intel doesn't match any of the policies that Linux provides.<br /><br />In an attempt to address this, I've <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/4/18/76">written some patches</a>. The aim here is to provide two new policies. The first simply inherits whichever configuration the firmware has provided, on the assumption that the system vendor probably didn't configure their system to corrupt data out of the box[1]. The second implements the policy that Intel use in IRST. With luck we'll be able to use the firmware settings by default and switch to the IRST settings on Intel mobile devices.<br /><br />This change alone drops my idle power consumption from around 8.5W to about 5W. One reason we'd pretty much ignored this in the past was that SATA power management simply wasn't that big a win. Even at its most aggressive, we'd struggle to see 0.5W of saving. But on these new parts, the SATA link state is the difference between going to PC2 and going to PC7, and the difference between those states is a large part of the CPU package being powered up.<br /><br />But this isn't the full story. There's still work to be done on other components, especially the GPU. Keeping the link between the GPU and an internal display panel active is both a power suck and requires additional chipset components to be powered up. Embedded Displayport 1.3 introduced a new feature called Panel Self-Refresh that permits the GPU and the screen to negotiate dropping the link, leaving it up to the screen to maintain its contents. There's patches to enable this on Intel systems, but it's still not turned on by default. Doing so increases the amount of time spent in PC7 and brings corresponding improvements to battery life.<br /><br />This trend is likely to continue. As systems become more integrated we're going to have to pay more attention to the interdependencies in order to obtain the best possible power consumption, and that means that distribution vendors are going to have to spend some time figuring out what these dependencies are and what the appropriate default policy is for their users. Intel's done the work to add kernel support for most of these features, but they're not the ones shipping it to end-users. Let's figure out how to make this right out of the box.<br /><br />[1] This is not necessarily a good assumption, but hey, let's see<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=34868" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

	<section>
		<h3 id="Overall+goals+for+the+coming+month">Overall goals for the coming month</h3>

<p>We've begun tracking prioritization of all Public Lab coding in this Waffle.io board: <a href="https://waffle.io/publiclab/plots2">https://waffle.io/publiclab/plots2</a>, where "Ready" are on deck for the next week or two, and "Priority" are requests from community or staff for important coding projects to be taken on in the coming weeks. Some of these are big projects -- like MapKnitter Annotations 2.0 -- but many are also simple bug fixes. In general, <strong>we're beginning to pivot away from MapKnitter towards Spectral Workbench</strong> and anticipate big changes in calibration, graphing, and more, especially taking advantage of the huge infrastructural work that's gone on in the past month.</p>

<p>Input and feedback -- not to mention testing -- from community members is essential; thanks for your help! If you'd like to bump up or request priority for a feature or bug, please feel free to leave a comment here and we'll see what we can do. For a more complete look at our planned work in the next month, <a href="https://waffle.io/publiclab/plots2">check out the Waffle.io board</a> in the Priority and Ready column.</p>

<p>The major milestones we're working on this month are:</p>

<ul>
<li>parts of <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/milestones/2.0%20launch">Spectral Workbench 2.0</a> (6 of 57 issues done, yikes!)</li>
<li>parts of the <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/milestones/Graphing%20design%20overhaul">Spectral Workbench graphing system</a> (9 open issues)</li>
<li>parts of <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/milestones/2.1%20release">MapKnitter 2.1</a> (29 open issues)</li>
</ul>


<p>This is also a good moment to try to recruit some more coding contributors! We provide a lot of software for free, and it's the contributions of community members which enable us to keep refining, expanding, and improving these systems! If you code, or know someone who does, consider <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/wiki/developers">joining the Developers discussion list</a>, introduce yourself, and see where you can pitch in!</p>

<h3 id="MapKnitter">MapKnitter</h3>

<p>LOTS of work was done on <a href="http://mapknitter.org">MapKnitter</a> since the MapKnitter 2.0 launch in mid-February; 1,452 files have changed since the start of March and there have been 983 lines of code changed or added. Most was to do with exporting, embedding, and tagging, along with lots of bugfixes, but the biggest change was <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/03-19-2015/automatic-placement-of-images-in-mapknitter-using-gps-metadata">image auto-placement with GPS tags</a>. We also got a new logo and "look" -- as pictured above. <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/pulse/monthly">15 new issues</a> were also created, however, and we have a major one with Firefox compatibility.</p>

<p>12 issues were closed, total -- <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/pulse/monthly">read more in Github Pulse</a></p>

<ul>

<h3 id="SpectralWorkbench">SpectralWorkbench</h3>

<p><a href="http://spectralworkbench.org">Spectral Workbench</a> is gearing up for some big changes; some of these have been delayed by ongoing MapKnitter work and some plots2 work, but this month, 4 authors pushed 42 commits to our master branch. 110 files and 2,651 lines of code changed! This was mostly cleanup and debugging, as well as some login sequence reworking, but also included moving all SW's static assets into the Rails asset pipeline, which makes development much easier and more legible, and slimmed down the project overall. It's now <strong>much easier</strong> to install the Spectral Workbench codebase!</p>

<p>14 issues were closed, total -- <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench/pulse/monthly">read more in Github Pulse</a> -- and 15 new issues were opened, largely through the excellent <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/notes/warren/02-10-2015/planning-for-spectral-workbench-2-0">feedback in this call for input</a></p>

<p>PublicLab.org saw quite a bit of activity as well; as in Spectral Workbench, it was ported into the Rails asset pipeline, and login sequence, menus, page sorting, and the wiki index were all improved. 2 authors pushed 41 commits to the project, 449 files and 9,996 lines of code were changed and 66,047 were deleted -- mostly in the asset pipeline reorganization. It's now <strong>much easier</strong> to install the plots2 codebase, too!</p>

		<p><a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/nshapiro">@nshapiro</a> and I are working on a card upon which you can place a colorimetric tube for detecting formaldehyde, and take a photo of it to record data. Nick sent me the above sketch, and I doodled a design idea below. I figured we could prototype this idea out and further develop it in this research note.</p>

	<section>
		One project I've worked on at <a href="http://www.nebula.com">Nebula</a> is a Python module for remote configuration of server hardware. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/nebula/firmware_config">here</a>, but there's a few caveats:<ol><li>It's not hugely well tested on a wide range of hardware<li>The interface is not yet guaranteed to be stable<li>You'll also need <a href="https://github.com/nebula/python-eficompressor">this</a> module if you want to deal with IBM (well, Lenovo now) servers<li>The IBM support is based on <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/29210.html">reverse engineering</a> rather than documentation, so who really knows how good it is</li></li></li></li></ol><br />There's documentation in the README, and I'm sorry for the API being kind of awful (it suffers rather heavily from me writing Python while knowing basically no Python). Still, it ought to work. I'm interested in hearing from anybody with problems, anybody who's interested in getting it on Pypi and anybody who's willing to add support for new HP systems.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=34811" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

		<p>After a long wait, I've finally integrated <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/xvidun">@xvidun</a>'s feature of <a href="http://publiclab.org/notes/xvidun/07-31-2014/gsoc-upadate-upload-interface">automatically placing images</a> on a MapKnitter map if they have GPS EXIF metadata -- that is, if they've been taken from a smartphone or camera with a GPS. I implemented only placement in latitude/longitude so far, but we should be able to expand this to figure out rough compass heading and altitude with a bit of extra work.</p>

<p>To use this new feature, just drag images which have GPS EXIF data in them onto a MapKnitter map, then click "Auto-place with GPS". <a href="http://mapknitter.org">MapKnitter</a> does the rest!</p>

	<section>
		Getting on for seven years ago, <a href="http://mjg59.livejournal.com/96129.html">I wrote an article on why the Linux kernel responds "False" to _OSI("Linux")</a>. This week I discovered that vendors were making use of another behavioural difference between Linux and Windows to change the behaviour of their firmware and breaking things in the process.<br /><br />The ACPI spec defines the _REV object as evaluating "to the revision of the ACPI Specification that the specified \_OS implements as a DWORD. Larger values are newer revisions of the ACPI specification", ie you reference _REV and you get back the version of the spec that the OS implements. Linux returns 5 for this, because Linux (broadly) implements ACPI 5.0, and Windows returns 2 because fuck you that's why[1].<br /><br />(An aside: To be fair, Windows maybe has kind of an argument here because the spec explicitly says "The revision of the ACPI Specification that the specified \_OS implements" and all modern versions of Windows still claim to be Windows NT in \_OS and eh you can kind of make an argument that NT in the form of 2000 implemented ACPI 2.0 so handwave)<br /><br />This would all be fine except firmware vendors appear to earnestly believe that they should ensure that their platforms work correctly with RHEL 5 even though there aren't any drivers for anything in their hardware and so are looking for ways to identify that they're on Linux so they can just randomly break various bits of functionality. I've now found two systems (an HP and a Dell) that check the value of _REV. The HP checks whether it's 3 or 5 and, if so, behaves like an old version of Windows and reports fewer backlight values and so on. The Dell checks whether it's 5 and, if so, leaves the sound hardware in a strange partially configured state.<br /><br />And so, as a result, I've posted <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/3/12/149">this patch</a> which sets _REV to 2 on X86 systems because every single more subtle alternative leaves things in a state where vendors can just find another way to break things.<br /><br />[1] Verified by hacking qemu's DSDT to make _REV calls at various points and dump the output to the debug console - I haven't found a single scenario where modern Windows returns something other than "2"<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=34542" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

		<p><a href="http://www.oshwa.org/about/our-team/">Alicia Gibb</a> of OSHWA and I (I'm on their board) cooked up the idea, chatting a few months ago, of a "spec" for a file similar to the CONTRIBUTORS or <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/CREDITS">CREDITS text files</a> found in some FOSS projects -- a kind of text file format for describing your project and providing key information. So, a little broader than just listing contributors, but really fulfilling all of the <a href="http://www.oshwa.org/definition/">Open Source Hardware Definition</a>. As it'd be machine readable, it could form the basis for a repository -- the URLs to these files in different peoples' online posted docs could be scraped and indexed.</p>

<p>This sample has a lot of ideas, some better than others, but the most minimal example would be really short; just <code>title</code>, <code>version</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>license</code>, <code>contributors</code>, and <code>source_files</code>.</p>

<p>What do you think? It's a slightly more concrete way to kick off any discussions of repositories, and people could begin creating these "contributors.json" files now, which could help in later attempts to create a more comprehensive directory of open hardware projects.</p>

<p>Basically this is just a rough proposal, but it wouldn't be too hard for Public Lab tool pages to provide such a standardized JSON file, and perhaps others would adopt it as a draft standard?</p>

The level of incompetence involved here is so staggering that it wouldn't be a gross injustice for the company to go under as a result[1]. But let's not pretend that this is some sort of isolated incident. As an industry, we don't care about user security. We will gladly ship products with known security failings and no plans to update them. We will produce devices that are locked down such that it's impossible for anybody else to fix our failures. We will hide behind vague denials, we will obfuscate the impact of flaws and we will deflect criticisms with announcements of new and shinier products that will make everything better.<br /><br />It'd be wonderful to say that this is limited to the proprietary software industry. I would love to be able to argue that we respect users more in the free software world. But there are too many cases that demonstrate otherwise, even where we should have the opportunity to prove the benefits of open development. An obvious example is the smartphone market. Hardware vendors will frequently fail to provide timely security updates, and will cease to update devices entirely after a very short period of time. Fortunately there's a huge community of people willing to produce updated firmware. Phone manufacturer is never going to fix the latest OpenSSL flaw? As long as your phone can be unlocked, there's a reasonable chance that there's an updated version on the internet.<br /><br />But this is let down by a kind of callous disregard for any deeper level of security. Almost every single third-party Android image is either unsigned or signed with the "test keys", a set of keys distributed with the Android source code. These keys are publicly available, and as such anybody can sign anything with them. If you configure your phone to allow you to install these images, anybody with physical access to your phone can replace your operating system. You've gained some level of security at the application level by giving up any real ability to trust your operating system.<br /><br />This is symptomatic of our entire ecosystem. We're happy to tell people to disable security features in order to install third-party software. We're happy to tell people to download and build source code without providing any meaningful way to verify that it hasn't been tampered with. Install methods for popular utilities often still start "curl | sudo bash". This isn't good enough.<br /><br />We can laugh at proprietary vendors engaging in dreadful security practices. We can feel smug about giving users the tools to choose their own level of security. But until we're actually making it straightforward for users to choose freedom without giving up security, we're not providing something meaningfully better - we're just providing the same shit sandwich on different bread.<br /><br />[1] I don't see any way that they will, but it wouldn't upset me<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=34069" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

	<section>
		PC World <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2883903/how-intel-and-pc-makers-prevent-you-from-modifying-your-pcs-firmware.html">wrote an article</a> on how the use of Intel Boot Guard by PC manufacturers is making it impossible for end-users to install replacement firmware such as Coreboot on their hardware. It's easy to interpret this as Intel acting to restrict competition in the firmware market, but the reality is actually a little more subtle than that.<br /><br />UEFI Secure Boot as a specification is still unbroken, which makes attacking the underlying firmware much more attractive. We've seen several presentations at security conferences lately that have demonstrated vulnerabilities that permit modification of the firmware itself. Once you can insert arbitrary code in the firmware, Secure Boot doesn't do a great deal to protect you - the firmware could be modified to boot unsigned code, or even to modify your signed bootloader such that it backdoors the kernel on the fly.<br /><br />But that's not all. Someone with physical access to your system could reflash your system. Even if you're paranoid enough that you X-ray your machine after every border crossing and verify that no additional components have been inserted, modified firmware could still be grabbing your disk encryption passphrase and stashing it somewhere for later examination.<br /><br />Intel Boot Guard is intended to protect against this scenario. When your CPU starts up, it reads some code out of flash and executes it. With Intel Boot Guard, the CPU verifies a signature on that code before executing it[1]. The hash of the public half of the signing key is flashed into fuses on the CPU. It is the system vendor that owns this key and chooses to flash it into the CPU, not Intel.<br /><br />This has genuine security benefits. It's no longer possible for an attacker to simply modify or replace the firmware - they have to find some other way to trick it into executing arbitrary code, and over time these will be closed off. But in the process, the system vendor has prevented the user from being able to make an informed choice to replace their system firmware.<br /><br />The usual argument here is that in an increasingly hostile environment, opt-in security isn't sufficient - it's the role of the vendor to ensure that users are as protected as possible by default, and in this case all that's sacrificed is the ability for a few hobbyists to replace their system firmware. But this is a false dichotomy - UEFI Secure Boot demonstrated that it was entirely possible to produce a security solution that provided security benefits and still gave the user ultimate control over the code that their machine would execute.<br /><br />To an extent the market will provide solutions to this. Vendors such as <a href="http://puri.sm">Purism</a> will sell modern hardware without enabling Boot Guard. However, many people will buy hardware without consideration of this feature and only later become aware of what they've given up. It should never be necessary for someone to spend more money to purchase new hardware in order to obtain the freedom to run their choice of software. A future where users are obliged to run proprietary code because they can't afford another laptop is a dystopian one.<br /><br />Intel should be congratulated for taking steps to make it more difficult for attackers to compromise system firmware, but criticised for doing so in such a way that vendors are forced to choose between security and freedom. The ability to control the software that your system runs is fundamental to Free Software, and we must reject solutions that provide security at the expense of that ability. As an industry we should endeavour to identify solutions that provide both freedom and security and work with vendors to make those solutions available, and as a movement we should be doing a better job of articulating why this freedom is a fundamental part of users being able to place trust in their property.<br /><br />[1] It's slightly more complicated than that in reality, but the specifics really aren't that interesting.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=33981" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

		<p>Hello, mapmakers!</p>

<p>The Web Working Group has just launched the final version of MapKnitter 2, integrating all of the past summer's work and a <strong>great deal more</strong> into a near-complete overhaul of the platform. Much has changed for the better.</p>

<p>Try it out at <a href="http://mapknitter.org">http://mapknitter.org</a></p>

<p>This is such a major revamp that we're SURE there are lots of issues, bugs, oddnesses, etc. -- so PLEASE use Github to report any issues, and mention your browser and OS:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/new">https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/new</a></p>

<p>Also, check out the issues I've already posted here: <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues">https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues</a></p>

<p>In particular, <strong>exporting is not running smoothly for everyone yet</strong> -- however, this seems to potentially be a memory issue that was affecting the system before MapKnitter 2; we're not convinced this is due to the new code. Stay tuned for updates on that, and apologies for the trouble.</p>

<p>All old maps should work in the new interface, and for the time being we've preserved most of the "Legacy" MapKnitter interface to ease the transition for folks.</p>

<h3 id="What+makes+MapKnitter+2+different?">What makes MapKnitter 2 different?</h3>

<ul>
<li>it can handle more images, more smoothly; >60 images are still smooth</li>
<li>no odd gridlines or artifacts during distortion</li>
<li>finger-friendly on smartphones and tablets with touch interfaces</li>
<li>more modular, extensible -- based on the <a href="http://leafletjs.com">widely used and simple Leaflet map library</a></li>
<li>the new <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage">image distortion code</a> can be used in any Leaflet-based project, thanks to hard work by <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/anishshah101">Anish</a> and <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/justinmanley">Justin's</a></li>
<li>it features new upload interface based on <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/xvidun">Vidhun</a> and <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/justinmanley">Justin's</a> work</li>

<li>using GPS EXIF tags in images to roughly place each one</li>
<li>brand new MapKnitter Annotations 2 by Justin Manley</li>
<li>full resolution imagery mode if you've got the bandwidth and CPU</li>
<li>potentially live-editing, so you can see other peoples' edits in near-realtime</li>

		<p>Hello, mapmakers!</p>

<p>The Web Working Group has set up a testing version of MapKnitter 2, integrating all of the past summer's work and a <strong>great deal more</strong> into a near-complete overhaul of the platform. Much has changed for the better.</p>

<p>This is a limited testing release, which uses a copy of real data, a snapshot from October, but does not allow image uploading or deletion, or affect the live MapKnitter.org site.</p>

<p>This is such a major revamp that we're SURE there are lots of issues, bugs, oddnesses, etc. -- that's why we're launching a test server, which you can find here:</p>

<p><a href="http://test.mapknitter.org:3000/">http://test.mapknitter.org:3000/</a></p>

<p>All old maps should work in the new interface, and for the time being we've preserved most of the "Legacy" MapKnitter interface to ease the transition for folks.</p>

<p>We'd like to spend the next few days ironing out issues, etc, in preparation for an actual launch. Later, we'll be adding new features on the clean, shiny new foundation that this release creates for us. We're PRETTY CLOSE to launch ready, having run this by the <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/wiki/developers">Public Lab developers group</a> and the <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/wiki/organizers">Organizers group</a>; our outstanding feature/bug list is now at 100% complete:</p>

	<section>
		<p>Hello <a href="http://spectralworkbench.org">Spectral Workbench</a> community!</p>

<p><strong>Do you wish you could do more with Spectral Workbench?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do you have trouble with a particular feature or recurring bug?</strong></p>

<p>In coming weeks we'll be beginning a major revamp for Spectral Workbench, similar to the scale of the recent work on MapKnitter 2. Towards that end, and because <a href="https://github.com/publiclab/spectral-workbench">SW is open source software</a>, we're asking everyone to consider making suggestions for new features, bugfixes, refinements, etc. -- and to help prioritize these so that we can decide what to do first.</p>

<p>In the comments below, please offer suggestions and ask questions! Please provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>a succinct description of the thing you'd like</li>
<li>a description of your problem if applicable</li>
<li>a few words of context for why you think this is important</li>
<li>(optional) suggestions for how to implement such a fix, or how it might be designed</li>
</ul>

</p>

</p>

<p>
I haven't read any Proust. It's mortifying. There are episodes of "The Golden Girls" I've seen a dozen times, and I haven't cracked open Proust. I'm trying to start a Dive Bar Proust Club, where we meet regularly at dive bars to discuss Proust, but the people I invite keep asking, "Do we have to meet at dive bars?" or "Do we have to read Proust?"

	<section>
		<p>When you buy a video game, you expect to be able to play it for as long as you want. You expect be able to play it with your kids many years from now if you want (well, maybe not Grand Theft Auto).  And you would hope that museums and media historians could preserve the games that were so important to your childhood. But unfortunately, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca-rulemaking" title="DMCA Rulemaking">anti-circumvention provisions</a> (17 U.S.C. § 1201, or Section 1201) creates legal risks for players who want to keep playing after game servers shut down, and curators who want to preserve games for posterity. That’s why I’m spearheading an effort to win legal protection for game enthusiasts and preservationists who want to keep abandoned games alive by running multiplayer servers or eliminating authentication mechanisms. On Friday, EFF and I filed <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/eff-comments-dmca-exemption-abandoned-games" title="EFF Comments on a DMCA Exemption for Abandoned Games">comments</a> with the Copyright Office asking for a new exemption to Section 1201.</p><!-- more --><p>Each year, more and more video games have their servers shut down. For some of those games, such as Mario Kart Wii, players set up servers to keep communities alive.  Enthusiasts regard this as a labor of love – a tribute to a game they cared about or had a special connection to, a way to keep a great game’s lights on for just a little longer. But they face legal risks, as changing a game so it doesn’t need to connect to a server that no longer exists could violate Section 1201’s ban on circumventing “technical protection measures.”</p><p>Game developers and distributors don’t run servers forever, and often shut them off when player numbers dwindle. Having player communities step in to preserve their games is a win for everyone. However, Section 1201 creates chilling effects that keep this from happening. And for games without dedicated programmers who are willing to take legal risks, communities disperse, moving on to new games or just disappearing entirely.</p><p>Section 1201 also has chilling effects on people who want to preserve or archive games, both those who are affiliated with formal institutions and those who are just enthusiasts. As digital archiving expert Henry Lowood explains, “Repositories and researchers [are forced] into the uncomfortable situation of considering unauthorized circumvention of copyright law in order to preserve or provide access to game and virtual world environments, data, and software.” Archiving and preserving playable copies is essential to future researchers, especially ones who wish to study the multiplayer components and the design of modern games.  In the words of game community sociologist T.L. Taylor, “playing together is not a trivial side aspect to digital gaming and this means that scholars need to be able to emulate conditions of original use as much as possible.”</p><p>The exemption that we proposed covers games where single-player or multiplayer play is no longer possible, either because the game’s developers have shut down servers or abandoned them. (It does not cover massively multiplayer online games with persistent worlds.) Experts from the Internet Archive, Stanford University, MIT, and the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment filed statements in support of the exemption.</p><p>We think Section 1201 is an unsound, overbroad statute that chills huge amounts of legal reverse-engineering. And it allows companies to maintain a chokehold on their works even after they give up on the communities that love them. It shouldn’t exist. But since it does, we ask the Library of Congress to grant an exemption to help enthusiasts of all types continue to play and preserve the games they lawfully own.</p><p><i>Crossposted from the EFF&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.eff.org/let-game-fans-keep-abandoned-games-running">Deeplinks blog</a>.</i></p>

		<h3 id="Overview">Overview</h3>

<p>This quarter, we moved all major services into Rackspace hosting, taking full advantage of Public Lab’s donated space there. This will eventually reduce monitoring costs with Pingdom as well, since that service is included in Rackspace’s offerings. We will soon using almost the entire donated space! Public Lab is growing, growing...</p>

<p>Web development has been prioritized in the latter half of the quarter, and major infrastructural upgrades were completed for the <a href="http://mapknitter.org">MapKnitter</a> and <a href="http://spectralworkbench.org">Spectral Workbench</a> services, which we hope will result in greater volunteer participation in code improvement, bug fixes and feature development.</p>

<h3 id="Contributors+and+Google+Summer+of+Code">Contributors and Google Summer of Code</h3>

<p>Major integration of GSoC and other projects has been added to the coding projects at the end of this quarter; this is taking lots of time, but should soon result in a major overhaul of MapKnitter.org, and in the subsequent quarter, Spectral Workbench. Read a bit more in Justin Manley’s great post: <a href="http://publiclab.org/notes/justinmanley/12-21-2014/growing-the-public-lab-software-development-community">http://publiclab.org/notes/justinmanley/12-21-2014/growing-the-public-lab-software-development-community</a></p>

<h3 id="Servers+and+services">Servers and services</h3>

<p>Migrating servers took some services offline for a few hours, but uptime remains reasonably high: PublicLab.org was at 99.92% for the quarter, down from 99.98% last quarter; Spectral Workbench has seen some intermittent outages which may relate to the major upgrades and new code; we anticipate this will be resolved in the next quarter.</p>

<h3 id="Usage+++mailing+lists">Usage &amp; mailing lists</h3>

<p>We’ve seen continued strong <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/lists">mailing list</a> growth through the 4th quarter of 2014 -- around November 11th 2013, the main publiclaboratory group surpassed 3,000 members and at time of writing has 3,189, up from approx 1800 one year ago.</p>

<p>Three new lists were created in the last quarter of 2014--all in the Americas: regional list public-lab-northwest, chapter list public-lab-vancouver, and Portuguese language list publiclab-portugues. The northwest and vancouver lists are nested, a structure that demonstrates our a renewed commitment to regionalism without excluding popular city-specific lists. Notably, public-lab-northwest is the only list explicitly created to span national boundaries. Other examples of regional lists include US Midwest and US Northeast. We anticipate 2015 regional developments in the US Mountain West as well as the northern coast of South America (Peru, Ecuador, Colombia).</p>

<p>The Portuguese language mailing list emerged from a publicly facilitated conversation among over a dozen Brazilian members that began on a private email thread, then moved onto a research note that garnered over 50 comments; the list has grown rapidly to 25 members from Brazil and the US. In many ways, this was an ideal process of mailing list formation. The spectroscopy list gained an average of 50 new members each month in 2014 in contrast to the grassrootsmapping list which has been plateaued for the last two years.</p>

<p>Below: regional and chapter lists growth and development are tracked in CartoDB:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/601/original/Screen_Shot_2014-12-03_at_4.06.49_PM.png"><img alt="Screen_Shot_2014-12-03_at_4.06.49_PM.png" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/008/601/large/Screen_Shot_2014-12-03_at_4.06.49_PM.png" /></a></p>

<p>Other interesting statistics follow, including graphs of activity over the past 52 weeks; 2258 research notes have been posted by 378 contributors since almost 4 years ago; 278 since the last quarter.</p>

<p>Objects falling into a quiescent fluid leave an air-filled <a href="http://fuckyeahfluiddynamics.tumblr.com/tagged/cavity">cavity</a> in their wake. The cavity collapses quickly due to the pressure of the surrounding fluid; but while it lasts, the cavity carries a signature of the object that made it. The collage above shows a series of snapshots of the formation and collapse of a cavity created by a 20-petal disk. Although the disk is essentially circular with only a small variation along its circumference, the effects of those perturbations appear soon after formation in the sidewalls of the cavity and persist until after its pinch-off and collapse. For more cavity dynamics, <a href="http://stilton.tnw.utwente.nl/people/devaraj/research_f.html">see here</a>.

		<p>I took these portraits in a session at the open water workshop at Propeller, in New Orleans, tonight.</p>

<p>Each person was asked to select a random bit of electronics off a table, and to give it a name. Then they were asked to pretend it was a sensor which solved an environmental problem they had, and to name what it sensed.</p>

<p>I loved the activity because everyone gave their sensors "human" names, and it sort of seemed like they were describing "imaginary friends" who could detect the kinds of pollutants or environmental metrics they wish they could see. Enjoy the photos, and thanks to everyone who participated!</p>

<p>I spoke with Carl from the EPA at the Engadget Expand conference last Saturday, and we brainstormed a table that could:</p>

<ol>
<li>help people choose an environmental monitoring tool on the basis of cost, sensitivity, duration, complexity, etc</li>
<li>help the EPA and regulators understand the different kinds of monitoring being done by community groups</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="My+attempt+and+results">My attempt and results</h3>

<p>See the table above; I put together this test in Google Spreadsheets; if we add to it and refine it, I'd like to run it on a wiki page:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Ni9NOjZKiT6UwKLSd0DVPm0Crd9HXqkkXdWQEDWPX0/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Ni9NOjZKiT6UwKLSd0DVPm0Crd9HXqkkXdWQEDWPX0/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<h3 id="Questions+and+next+steps">Questions and next steps</h3>

<p>I took soil testing as a test case; added a couple Public Lab approaches as well as "photo narrative" which is where you just take lots of photos describing the situation -- an approach Carl said was very helpful to regulators -- and the UMASS Amherst soil lab tests. It's not fully filled out but feel free to add to it.</p>

<h3 id="Why+I'm+interested">Why I'm interested</h3>

<p>I'd like to situate each tool we develop in comparison to other options, to help us frame and design tools, and to help people frame questions and figure out how best to answer them.</p>

	<section>
		<p>I filed a DMCA 1201 exemption proposal with the EFF on Monday.</p>
<p>Section 1201 was passed as part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and makes it illegal to circumvent access controls to copyrighted works, even when the underlying use is fair. It has hit security researchers and the reverse-engineering community <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-16-years-under-dmca">especially hard</a>, as companies often use it to threaten legitimate disclosures of technical information.</p>
<p>It also means that reverse-engineering or modifying server protocols in order to run third party servers for video games occupies a strange legal space - on the one hand, there are some projects that do it, on the other, under the reasoning used by the court in the bnetd (<em><a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/blizzard-v-bnetd">Davidson Associates v. Jung</a></em>) case, it may be illegal.</p>
<p>This exemption aims to fix that problem, and if granted, will reduce the legal uncertainty surrounding format-shifting archived games. It&rsquo;s been amazing to talk to the folks in this community that care deeply about preserving the cultural heritage of video games, and I really hope the Copyright Office sees how valuable this exemption could be.</p>

	<section>
		I'm <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/28232.html">not a huge fan of Hacker News</a>[1]. My impression continues to be that it ends up promoting stories that align with the Silicon Valley narrative of meritocracy, technology will fix everything, regulation is the cancer killing agile startups, and discouraging stories that suggest that the world of technology is, broadly speaking, awful and we should all be ashamed of ourselves.<br /><br />But as a good data-driven person[2], wouldn't it be nice to have numbers rather than just handwaving? In the absence of a good public dataset, I scraped <a href="http://hackerslide.com">Hacker Slide</a> to get just over two months of data in the form of hourly snapshots of stories, their age, their score and their position. I then applied a trivial test:<ol><li>If the story is younger than any other story<li>and the story has a higher score than that other story<li>and the story has a worse ranking than that other story<li>and at least one of these two stories is on the front page</li></li></li></li></ol>then the story is considered to have been penalised.<br /><br />(note: "penalised" can have several meanings. It may be due to explicit flagging, or it may be due to an automated system deciding that the story is controversial or appears to be supported by a voting ring. There may be other reasons. I haven't attempted to separate them, because for my purposes it doesn't matter. The algorithm is discussed <a href="http://www.righto.com/2013/11/how-hacker-news-ranking-really-works.html">here</a>.)<br /><br />Now, ideally I'd classify my dataset based on manual analysis and classification of stories, but I'm lazy (see [2]) and so just tried some keyword analysis:<table><tr><td>Keyword<td>Penalised<td>Unpenalised</tr><tr><td>Women<td>13<td>4</tr><tr><td>Harass<td>2<td>0</tr><tr><td>Female<td>5<td>1</tr><br /><tr><td>Intel<td>2<td>3</tr><tr><td>x86<td>3<td>4</tr><tr><td>ARM<td>3<td>4</tr><tr><td>Airplane<td>1<td>2</tr><tr><td>Startup<td>46<td>26</tr><tr><td></table><br />A few things to note:<ol><li>Lots of stories are penalised. Of the front page stories in my dataset, I count 3240 stories that have some kind of penalty applied, against 2848 that don't. The default seems to be that some kind of detection will kick in.<li>Stories containing keywords that suggest they refer to issues around social justice <em>appear</em> more likely to be penalised than stories that refer to technical matters<li>There are other topics that are also disproportionately likely to be penalised. That's interesting, but not really relevant - I'm not necessarily arguing that social issues are penalised out of an active desire to make them go away, merely that the existing ranking system tends to result in it happening anyway.</li></li></li></ol><br />This clearly isn't an especially rigorous analysis, and in future I hope to do a better job. But for now the evidence appears consistent with my innate prejudice - the Hacker News ranking algorithm tends to penalise stories that address social issues. An interesting next step would be to attempt to infer whether the reasons for the penalties are similar between different categories of penalised stories[3], but I'm not sure how practical that is with the publicly available data.<br /><br />(Raw data is <a href="http://www.codon.org.uk/~mjg59/hn_data">here</a>, penalised stories are <a href="http://www.codon.org.uk/~mjg59/hn_data/penalised">here</a>, unpenalised stories are <a href="http://www.codon.org.uk/~mjg59/hn_data/unpenalised">here</a>)<br /><br /><br />[1] Moving to San Francisco has resulted in it making more sense, but really that just makes me even more depressed.<br />[2] Ha ha like fuck my PhD's in biology<br />[3] Perhaps stories about startups tend to get penalised because of voter ring detection from people trying to promote their startup, while stories about social issues tend to get penalised because of controversy detection?<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=33551" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

	<h1>2014-10-30 01:45:32: <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/33455.html">On joining the FSF board</a> by mjg59 via <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/">Matthew Garrett</a></h1>
	<section>
		I joined the board of directors of the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a> a couple of weeks ago. I've been travelling a bunch since then, so haven't really had time to write about it. But since I'm currently waiting for a test job to finish, why not?<br /><br />It's impossible to overstate how important free software is. A movement that began with a quest to <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch01.html">work around a faulty printer</a> is now our greatest defence against a world full of hostile actors. Without the ability to examine software, we can have no real faith that we haven't been put at risk by backdoors introduced through incompetence or malice. Without the freedom to modify software, we have no chance of updating it to deal with the new challenges that we face on a daily basis. Without the freedom to pass that modified software on to others, we are unable to help people who don't have the technical skills to protect themselves.<br /><br />Free software isn't sufficient for building a trustworthy computing environment, one that not merely protects the user but <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/32686.html?thread=1195438"><em>respects</em> the user</a>. But it <em>is</em> necessary for that, and that's why I continue to evangelise on its behalf at every opportunity.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />Free software has a problem. It's natural to write software to satisfy our own needs, but in doing so we write software that doesn't provide as much benefit to people who have different needs. We need to listen to others, improve our knowledge of their requirements and ensure that they are in a position to benefit from the freedoms we espouse. And that means building diverse communities, communities that are inclusive regardless of people's race, gender, sexuality or economic background. Free software that ends up designed primarily to meet the needs of well-off white men is a failure. We do not improve the world by ignoring the majority of people in it. To do that, we need to listen to others. And to do that, we need to ensure that our community is accessible to everybody.<br /><br />That's not the case right now. We are a community that is disproportionately male, disproportionately white, disproportionately rich. This is made strikingly obvious by looking at the composition of the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board">FSF board</a>, a body made up entirely of white men. In joining the board, I have perpetuated this. I do not bring new experiences. I do not bring an understanding of an entirely different set of problems. I do not serve as an inspiration to groups currently under-represented in our communities. I am, in short, a hypocrite.<br /><br />So why did I do it? Why have I joined an organisation whose founder I <a href="http://mjg59.livejournal.com/113408.html">publicly criticised</a> for making sexist jokes in a conference presentation? I'm afraid that my answer may not seem convincing, but in the end it boils down to feeling that I can make more of a difference from within than from outside. I am now in a position to ensure that the board never forgets to consider diversity when making decisions. I am in a position to advocate for programs that build us stronger, more representative communities. I am in a position to take responsibility for our failings and try to do better in future.<br /><br />People can justifiably conclude that I'm making excuses, and I can make no argument against that other than to be asked to be judged by my actions. I hope to be able to look back at my time with the FSF and believe that I helped make a positive difference. But maybe this is hubris. Maybe I am just perpetuating the status quo. If so, I absolutely deserve criticism for my choices. We'll find out in a few years.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=33455" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

	<h1>2014-10-23 08:47:36: <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/33170.html">Linux Container Security</a> by mjg59 via <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/">Matthew Garrett</a></h1>
	<section>
		First, read <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jpetazzo/docker-linux-containers-lxc-and-security">these slides</a>. Done? Good.<br /><br />(Edit: Just to clarify - these are not my slides. They're from a presentation Jerome Petazzoni gave at Linuxcon NA earlier this year)<br /><br />Hypervisors present a smaller attack surface than containers. This is somewhat mitigated in containers by using seccomp, selinux and restricting capabilities in order to reduce the number of kernel entry points that untrusted code can touch, but even so there is simply a greater quantity of privileged code available to untrusted apps in a container environment when compared to a hypervisor environment[1].<br /><br />Does this mean containers provide reduced security? That's an arguable point. In the event of a new kernel vulnerability, container-based deployments merely need to upgrade the kernel on the host and restart all the containers. Full VMs need to upgrade the kernel in each individual image, which takes longer and may be delayed due to the additional disruption. In the event of a flaw in some remotely accessible code running in your image, an attacker's ability to cause further damage may be restricted by the existing seccomp and capabilities configuration in a container. They may be able to escalate to a more privileged user in a full VM.<br /><br />I'm not really compelled by either of these arguments. Both argue that the security of your <em>container</em> is improved, but in almost all cases exploiting these vulnerabilities would require that an attacker already be able to run arbitrary code in your container. Many container deployments are task-specific rather than running a full system, and in that case your attacker is already able to compromise pretty much everything within the container. The argument's stronger in the Virtual Private Server case, but there you're trading that off against losing some other security features - sure, you're deploying seccomp, but you can't use selinux <em>inside</em> your container, because the policy isn't per-namespace[2].<br /><br />So that seems like kind of a wash - there's maybe marginal increases in practical security for certain kinds of deployment, and perhaps marginal decreases for others. We end up coming back to the attack surface, and it seems inevitable that that's always going to be larger in container environments. The question is, does it matter? If the larger attack surface still only results in one more vulnerability per thousand years, you probably don't care. The aim isn't to get containers to the same level of security as hypervisors, it's to get them close enough that the difference doesn't matter.<br /><br />I don't think we're there yet. Searching the kernel for bugs triggered by <a href="http://codemonkey.org.uk/projects/trinity/">Trinity</a> shows plenty of cases where the kernel screws up from unprivileged input[3]. A sufficiently strong seccomp policy plus tight restrictions on the ability of a container to touch /proc, /sys and /dev helps a lot here, but it's not full coverage. The presentation I linked to at the top of this post suggests using the grsec patches - these will tend to mitigate several (but not all) kernel vulnerabilities, but there's tradeoffs in (a) ease of management (having to build your own kernels) and (b) performance (several of the grsec options reduce performance).<br /><br />But this isn't intended as a complaint. Or, rather, it is, just not about security. I suspect containers <em>can</em> be made sufficiently secure that the attack surface size doesn't matter. But who's going to do that work? As mentioned, modern container deployment tools make use of a number of kernel security features. But there's been something of a dearth of contributions from the companies who sell container-based services. Meaningful work here would include things like:<ul><br /><li>Strong auditing and aggressive fuzzing of containers under realistic configurations<br /><li>Support for meaningful nesting of Linux Security Modules in namespaces<br /><li>Introspection of container state and (more difficult) the host OS itself in order to identify compromises</li></li></li></ul><br />These aren't easy jobs, but they're important, and I'm hoping that the lack of obvious development in areas like this is merely a symptom of the youth of the technology rather than a lack of meaningful desire to make things better. But until things improve, it's going to be far too easy to write containers off as a "convenient, cheap, secure: choose two" tradeoff. That's not a winning strategy.<br /><br />[1] Companies using hypervisors! Audit your qemu setup to ensure that you're not providing more emulated hardware than necessary to your guests. If you're using KVM, ensure that you're using sVirt (either selinux or apparmor backed) in order to restrict qemu's privileges.<br />[2] There's apparently some support for loading per-namespace Apparmor policies, but that means that the process is no longer confined by the sVirt policy<br />[3] To be fair, last time I ran Trinity under Docker under a VM, it ended up killing my <em>host</em>. Glass houses, etc.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=33170" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

	<section>
		<h3 id="What+I+want+to+do">What I want to do</h3>

<p>I was thinking we might be able to do a crude but very fast CFL detection by measuring the amount of contrast in spectra, so I wrote a script (could have used the API but wanted it to be loaded by default) to try it out. I ended up being a little more complex once I tried it out on a lot of spectra; I discarded sections with low slope, too.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/007/606/original/continuous.png"><img alt="continuous.png" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/007/606/medium/continuous.png" /></a></p>

<h3 id="My+attempt+and+results">My attempt and results</h3>

<p>So it kind of measures how spiky a spectrum is, and does an OK job! It could use some tweaking and testing. My thought was to run this "cheap" method, then run a more complex matching if we have higher confidence that it's a CFL.</p>

<p>Try it out at <a href="http://spectralworkbench.org/capture">http://spectralworkbench.org/capture</a> (you may be prompted to reload the page once the cache clears) -- there's a little "lightbulb" button that will turn red if it thinks you're looking at a CFL.</p>

<p>Screenshots would be nice either if it works well or if it doesn't, to debug.</p>

<h3 id="Questions+and+next+steps">Questions and next steps</h3>

<p><a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/sreyanth">@sreyanth</a> - does your code have a "degree of confidence" that it's found a CFL? Like, say it finds blue and green, but red doesn't match up. Is there some way to have a 'threshold' where it's like "yes, this is a CFL"?</p>

<h3 id="Why+I'm+interested">Why I'm interested</h3>

<p>In any case the dream is that the capture interface auto-detects a CFL and prompts you to auto-calibrate (the latter using <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/sreyanth">@sreyanth</a>'s new code)</p>

	<section>
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been recovering from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-concussion_syndrome" target="_blank">Post-Concussion Syndrome</a> for the past 7 weeks or so. Now that I&rsquo;ve been getting back to work, I wanted to share a few things that I&rsquo;ve found particularly helpful for keeping up with my work without hurting my brain.</p>
<p>The first things I&rsquo;ve learned to do better are to ask for help and delegate where I can. I&rsquo;m trying to focus on tasks that only I can do. I&rsquo;m also learning to keep emails more brief and not send essays/rants that require a long time to compose (if I need to, I set up a meeting or a quick phone call). I&rsquo;ve also avoided browsing on social media as I tend to get sucked in easily and need to save my precious screen time for work.</p>
<p>I downloaded an app called <a href="http://iamfutureproof.com/tools/awareness/" target="_blank">awareness</a> (mac) that gives you a soft reminder (the sound of a meditation bowl ringing) whenever your designated work duration is up, and automatically resets itself when you&rsquo;ve taken a break for your designated break duration. It also shows how long you&rsquo;ve been using your computer without a break in the task bar. I found this helps keep me from idly using my computer and reminds me to give my eyes and brain a short screen break (&gt; 3 minutes) every 20 minutes or so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been sporting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BQ7KBV4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">computer glasses</a> when I look at any sort of screen for more than a few seconds, which help reduce eye strain and definitely seem to help prevent my headaches. I didn&rsquo;t have an appreciation for how aggressive projector screens and fluorescent lights are until my head injury, and these really help.</p>
<p>I try to charge my laptop up for the day, and then use it on battery power throughout the day. I try to plan out any writing or work I have to do on a piece of paper before I start so I&rsquo;m focused on the task at hand when I open my laptop up. If I run through the battery in a day, it&rsquo;s a sign that I should consider taking the rest of the day easy to give myself a rest.</p>
<p>If anyone has other thoughts on more efficient/mindful computer use, I&rsquo;d love to hear more.</p>

	<section>
		<h3 id="What+I+want+to+do">What I want to do</h3>

<p>At the <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/notes/stevie/08-01-2014/recap-july-31-new-orleans-oil-testing-meetup">New Orleans oil testing meetup</a>, started using reflective foil mylar (like the inside of a potato chip bag, as <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/stevie">@stevie</a> is holding in the photo below) to increase brightness of fluorescence spectra, since we've had some trouble getting them to be bright enough for some webcams. If we increase brightness, we might also have a larger area of fluorescence and not need to worry as much about alignment.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/007/462/original/IMG_20140731_210411.jpg"><img alt="IMG_20140731_210411.jpg" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/007/462/medium/IMG_20140731_210411.jpg" /></a></p>

<h3 id="My+attempt+and+results">My attempt and results</h3>

<p>Started this in the comments of <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/notes/mathew/09-05-2014/using-gelatin-caps-for-oil-fluorescence#c10261">this research note</a>, where I wanted to try out foil reflectors.</p>

<p>The lead image (also at <a href="http://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/35937">http://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/35937</a>) shows just a photo of a cuvette, where I placed a strip of adhesive-backed foil on the back of a cuvette, but one thin enough to only affect the middle of the beam path. We should (and do, whoopee!) see a distinct sawtooth "notch" of higher brightness in the middle. I want to know how much this helps.</p>

<p>The red channel shows a ~25% increase in brightness; the green, more like 15-20%, but the blue is clipping in this image. I can try again, but we're talking about double-digit increases, which is super, and much more than I expected.</p>

<h3 id="Questions+and+next+steps">Questions and next steps</h3>

<p>I think this is enough to say that we should essentially always use foil reflectors. <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/mathew">@mathew</a> was also seeing clipping in a lot of spectra, which is the opposite problem. But we can always filter out some of the light; that's not a hard limit. I'm just glad we have a way to increase brightness now too.</p>

<h3 id="Why+I'm+interested">Why I'm interested</h3>

<p>Well, basically the more control we have over brightness, the better we can get a good signal-to-noise ratio and good dynamic range for our tests. A tiny square of foil is an easy addition!</p>

		A lot of the kernel work I've ended up doing has involved dealing with bugs on Intel-based systems - figuring out interactions between their hardware and firmware, reverse engineering features that they refuse to document, improving their power management support, handling platform integration stuff for their GPUs and so on. Some of this I've been paid for, but a bunch has been unpaid work in my spare time[1].<br /><br />Recently, as part of the anti-women #GamerGate campaign[2], a set of awful humans convinced Intel to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/2/6886747/intel-buckles-to-anti-feminist-campaign-by-pulling-ads-from-gaming">terminate an advertising campaign</a> because the site hosting the campaign had dared to suggest that the sexism present throughout the gaming industry might be a problem. Despite being awful humans, it is absolutely their right to request that a company choose to spend its money in a different way. And despite it being a dreadful decision, Intel is obviously entitled to spend their money as they wish. But I'm also free to spend my unpaid spare time as I wish, and I no longer wish to spend it doing unpaid work to enable an abhorrently-behaving company to sell more hardware. I won't be working on any Intel-specific bugs. I won't be reverse engineering any Intel-based features[3]. If the backlight on your laptop with an Intel GPU doesn't work, the number of fucks I'll be giving will fail to register on even the most sensitive measuring device.<br /><br />On the plus side, this is probably going to significantly reduce my gin consumption.<br /><br />[1] In the spirit of full disclosure: in some cases this has resulted in me being sent laptops in order to figure stuff out, and I was not always asked to return those laptops. My current laptop was purchased by me.<br /><br />[2] I appreciate that there are some people involved in this campaign who earnestly believe that they are working to improve the state of professional ethics in games media. That is a worthy goal! But you're allying yourself to a cause that disproportionately attacks women while ignoring almost every other conflict of interest in the industry. If this is what you care about, find a new way to do it - and perhaps deal with the rather more obvious cases involving giant corporations, rather than obsessing over indie developers.<br /><br />For avoidance of doubt, any comments arguing this point will be replaced with the phrase "Fart fart fart".<br /><br />[3] Except for the purposes of finding entertaining security bugs<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=32778" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

		<p>LinkedIn Launches University Rankings</p>

<p>I expect this will cause quite a lot of debate and discussion over the next few weeks. ;-)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/edu/rankings/us">https://www.linkedin.com/edu/rankings/us</a></p>

<p>University rankings are a little bit like reality TV. Everyone agrees the quality is terrible, and yet almost everyone is watching obsessively. This ranking is interesting, because it takes a simple data driven approach, looking at the job pathways and career decisions LinkedIn users make. The most popular rankings use a mix of input indicators (student to faculty ratio, etc.) and output indicators (citations of published research, etc.) and have been criticized for arbitrary results. I liked <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/14/the-order-of-things">this Malcolm Gladwell article</a> which showed how changing the relevance of individual indicators would completely change the results. LinkedIn on the other hand, argues it uses outcome indicators. </p>

<p>How the LinkedIn model works (<a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2014/10/01/ranking-universities-based-on-career-outcomes/">more detail here</a>) &gt; Using the huge amount of data LinkedIn has on individual’s education and career histories, it defines desirable companies for a number of professional fields, like software or finance. (I wonder if LinkedIn itself is one of the desirable companies.) It and then tracks how many graduates from a particular university, who chose a career in a field, ended up working for the most desirable companies in that field. </p>

<p>If employment is a competition, and university is your training camp, then getting hired by a desirable company means winning the gold medal. </p>

<p>While this approach is probably less arbitrary than previous rankings, it does come with a number of important reservations. One, it would be wrong to do, what almost everybody is immediately going to do -&gt; turn the picture around and start tinkering with the university education in order to make more graduates end up in the most desirable companies. We should absolutely prepare our graduates to be successful in any field they choose, but the most desirable companies of today may not even exist 15 years from now. There was a time when every software developer wanted to work at Microsoft, or at Yahoo. </p>

<p>There are also lots of other limitations and biases, which however won’t limit the amount of excitement this new ranking is likely to cause. For example, employers of a certain age and maturity will rank higher than small new organizations. There is no fast feedback for most entrepreneurial sectors of the future, those will take some time to show up in the data. </p>

<p>But overall I am intrigued to see LinkedIn step into this space, and consider it a useful nudge to all of us to have a meaningful conversation about what the role of the university of the future should be.  </p>

	<section>
		I had dinner with a friend this evening and ended up discussing the FSF's <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">four freedoms</a>. The fundamental premise of the discussion was that the freedoms guaranteed by free software are largely academic unless you fall into one of two categories - someone who is sufficiently skilled in the arts of software development to examine and modify software to meet their own needs, or someone who is sufficiently privileged[1] to be able to encourage developers to modify the software to meet their needs.<br /><br />The problem is that most people don't fall into either of these categories, and so the benefits of free software are often largely theoretical to them. Concentrating on philosophical freedoms without considering whether these freedoms provide meaningful benefits to most users risks these freedoms being perceived as abstract ideals, divorced from the real world - nice to have, but fundamentally not important. How can we tie these freedoms to issues that affect users on a daily basis?<br /><br />In the past the answer would probably have been along the lines of "Free software inherently respects users", but reality has pretty clearly disproven that. <a href="http://unity.ubuntu.com">Unity</a> is free software that is fundamentally designed to tie the user into services that provide financial benefit to Canonical, with user privacy as a secondary concern. Despite Android largely being free software, many users are left with phones that no longer receive security updates[2]. <a href="https://whispersystems.org/">Textsecure</a> is free software but the author requests that builds not be uploaded to third party app stores because there's no meaningful way for users to verify that the code has not been modified - and there's a direct incentive for hostile actors to modify the software in order to circumvent the security of messages sent via it.<br /><br />We're left in an awkward situation. Free software is fundamental to providing user privacy. The ability for third parties to continue providing security updates is vital for ensuring user safety. But in the real world, we are failing to make this argument - the freedoms we provide are largely theoretical for most users. The nominal security and privacy benefits we provide frequently don't make it to the real world. If users do wish to take advantage of the four freedoms, they frequently do so at a potential cost of security and privacy. Our focus on the four freedoms may be coming at a cost to the pragmatic freedoms that our users desire - the freedom to be free of surveillance (be that government or corporate), the freedom to receive security updates without having to purchase new hardware on a regular basis, the freedom to choose to run free software without having to give up basic safety features.<br /><br />That's why projects like the <a href="https://people.gnome.org/~federico/news-2014-08.html#the-safety-and-privacy-team">GNOME safety and privacy team</a> are so important. This is an example of tying the four freedoms to real-world user benefits, demonstrating that free software can be written and managed in such a way that it actually makes life better for the average user. Designing code so that users are fundamentally in control of any privacy tradeoffs they make is critical to empowering users to make informed decisions. Committing to meaningful audits of all network transmissions to ensure they don't leak personal data is vital in demonstrating that developers fundamentally respect the rights of those users. Working on designing security measures that make it difficult for a user to be tricked into handing over access to private data is going to be a necessary precaution against hostile actors, and getting it wrong is going to ruin lives.<br /><br />The four freedoms are only meaningful if they result in real-world benefits to the entire population, not a privileged minority. If your approach to releasing free software is merely to ensure that it has an approved license and throw it over the wall, you're doing it wrong. We need to design software from the ground up in such a way that those freedoms provide immediate and real benefits to our users. Anything else is a failure.<br /><br />(title courtesy of <a href="http://tigerbeatdown.com/2011/10/10/my-feminism-will-be-intersectional-or-it-will-be-bullshit/">My Feminism will be Intersectional or it will be Bullshit</a> by Flavia Dzodan. While I'm less angry, I'm solidly convinced that free software that does nothing to respect or empower users is an absolute waste of time)<br /><br />[1] Either in the sense of having enough money that you can simply pay, having enough background in the field that you can file meaningful bug reports or having enough followers on Twitter that simply complaining about something results in people fixing it for you<br /><br />[2] The free software nature of Android often makes it possible for users to receive security updates from a third party, but this is not always the case. Free software makes this kind of support more likely, but it is in no way guaranteed.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=32686" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

<p>At <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/tag/LEAFFEST2014">LEAFFEST 2014</a>, Mary, Luisa, and others reproduced the kind of fluorescence spectrometry scanning we've been doing with the <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/wiki/oil-testing-kit">Oil Testing Kit</a> using a lab spectrometer, an Ocean Optics device. We used the same 405nm laser pointer and the same samples -- of suspected BP crude, fish oil, and mail-ordered <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/tag/onta">crude from ONTA</a>, all dissolved in mineral oil, and plain mineral oil. Here are the graph and the files, which Louisa emailed to me:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/982/original/oilsamples_oceanoptics.png"><img alt="oilsamples_oceanoptics.png" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/982/large/oilsamples_oceanoptics.png" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Update: Mary sent me specs on the device, below:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Spectra were measured with an OceanOptics SD2000 dual spectrometer
(<a href="http://oceanoptics.com/wp-content/uploads/OEM-Data-Sheet-S2000.pdf">http://oceanoptics.com/wp-content/uploads/OEM-Data-Sheet-S2000.pdf</a>),
using the first spectrometer (wavelength range: 200-850nm; grating: 600 lines at 300nm; 25um slit).</p>

<p>Spectrometer is spectrally calibrated with a mercury/argon calibration
source (<a href="http://oceanoptics.com/product/hg-1/">http://oceanoptics.com/product/hg-1/</a>). Values are relative DN, and
are not radiometrically calibrated.</p></blockquote>

<p>I had to add ".txt" to the end of each file to get them to upload, but that also makes them easier to open up.</p>

<h3 id="Questions+and+next+steps">Questions and next steps</h3>

<p>Presumably the calibration is OK? And the intensities are adjusted -- linear -- unlike <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/wiki/spectrometer">our own spectrometer</a>. So it's could be a basis for calibrating our device, if we assume that the setup is similar enough.</p>

<p>I'm especially interested in importing this data into Spectral Workbench, and am working on a way to upload this format. For now, you can view one of the files on Github too; they're just a column of wavelengths, a column of intensities, and an index column counting from 0 upwards:</p>

	<section>
		<h3 id="What+I+want+to+do">What I want to do</h3>

<p>Based on the difficulties <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/mathew">@mathew</a> highlighted in <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/notes/mathew/09-22-2014/replicating-the-grading-of-oils-with-uv-fluorescence-on-other-cameras-pt-1">his research note yesterday</a>, I spent today developing a smoothing system (using the Spectral Workbench API: <a href="http://spectralworkbench.org/macro/warren/smooth_save">http://spectralworkbench.org/macro/warren/smooth_save</a>) which:</p>

<ul>
<li>saves its "smoothed" version of the data, so it can be compared in sets</li>
<li>tags the spectra with "smoothed:1+10" where the sampling row is 1 and we average in 10 additional rows below it</li>
</ul>


<p>I also created, at <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/mathew">@mathew</a>'s suggestion, a "equalize height" comparison tool (<a href="http://spectralworkbench.org/macro/warren/equalize-height">http://spectralworkbench.org/macro/warren/equalize-height</a>) for sets, since in some cases that may be more useful than the existing "equalize area" (<a href="http://spectralworkbench.org/macro/warren/equalize_area">http://spectralworkbench.org/macro/warren/equalize_area</a>).</p>

<h3 id="My+attempt+and+results">My attempt and results</h3>

<p>I've worked solely with the data <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/mathew">@mathew</a> collected in his note, so far. I'm writing this as I work, but a simple initial comparison of unsmoothed vs. smoothed data can be seen with these two sets:</p>

<ul>
<li>unsmoothed: <a href="http://spectralworkbench.org/sets/show/1475">http://spectralworkbench.org/sets/show/1475</a></li>
<li>smoothed: <a href="http://spectralworkbench.org/sets/show/1483">http://spectralworkbench.org/sets/show/1483</a></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/953/original/Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_8.52.53_PM.png"><img alt="Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_8.52.53_PM.png" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/953/large/Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_8.52.53_PM.png" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/954/original/Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_8.53.00_PM.png"><img alt="Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_8.53.00_PM.png" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/954/large/Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_8.53.00_PM.png" /></a></p>

<p>I've also run "equalize height" from the "More tools" menu to ease the comparison.</p>

<p>Next, I'm going to try it with a larger set, which includes samples of North Dakota crude oil and a variety of motor oils <a href="http://alpha.publiclaboratory.org/profile/mathew">@mathew</a> tested with the same webcam we use for the Infragram Webcam -- albeit <strong>without</strong> the blue or red filter: <a href="http://spectralworkbench.org/sets/show/1481">http://spectralworkbench.org/sets/show/1481</a></p>

<p>For each spectrum in that set, I:</p>

<ul>
<li>made a copy</li>
<li>checked for overexposure or clipping by looking for a flat-topped peak in RGB mode

<ul>
<li>if overexposed, selected a new cross section that was not</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>copied the calibration from <a href="http://spectralworkbench.org/analyze/spectrum/34198">this CFL spectrum</a></li>
<li>ran the new "Auto smooth 10 rows below" tool which just runs my macro (link above)</li>
</ul>


<p>I then added all of them into a new set:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/956/original/Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_9.20.34_PM.png"><img alt="Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_9.20.34_PM.png" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/956/large/Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_9.20.34_PM.png" /></a></p>

<p>Compare this with this collection, which is also height-equalized, but not smoothed:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/955/original/Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_9.20.03_PM.png"><img alt="Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_9.20.03_PM.png" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/955/large/Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_9.20.03_PM.png" /></a></p>

<p>The unsmoothed set has too much noise to infer much, although one does make out two "humps" -- one in the 520-580nm range and another in the 580-600nm range. But the smoothed version not only shows those much more clearly, it also shows how closely the two North Dakota crude samples align.</p>

<p>I think we can also see the 20W-50s aligning, and with them the 5W-30 until it diverges above 500nm. The 80W-90s also seem to be reasonably aligned.</p>

<p>The highest points of each type also seem to be occasionally different, although the 80W-90 and the crude are probably not distinguishable just on peak position -- but the secondary "hump" at 575 seems to make the crude stand out quite a bit.</p>

<h3 id="Questions+and+next+steps">Questions and next steps</h3>

<p>What are these "humps"? I theorize that although they're reproducible with a single camera/device, the actual hump shape is from the recombining of the RGB data from the camera's 3 color channels. You can see that the crude spectra's RGB data, when separated out, show matching peaks -- when combined, you get humps:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/957/original/Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_9.28.09_PM.png"><img alt="Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_9.28.09_PM.png" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/957/medium/Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_9.28.09_PM.png" /></a></p>

<p>The motor oils don't show that as much:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/958/original/Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_9.30.01_PM.png"><img alt="Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_9.30.01_PM.png" src="http://i.publiclab.org/system/images/photos/000/006/958/medium/Screen_Shot_2014-09-22_at_9.30.01_PM.png" /></a></p>

<p>However, although the humps themselves may be artifacts, they may be a consistent way to compare oils -- for the time being just on the same camera/spectrometer. I could imagine shipping heavier and lighter oils to "bracket" an unknown sample. Or, we could focus on peak position -- I do wonder if we don't mix channels at all, if the blue channel alone could be a more reliable measure of peak position.</p>

<p>Finally, we really need to help people watch out for clipping/overexposure. I think there should be an automatic indicator of where clipping is occurring on ANY saved spectrum. Maybe it could offer to help you identify a dimmer row where clipping isn't happening. Data like the below is not useful for comparison since the brightness is too high for the camera, flattening the top of the graph, but it's not very apparent until you go to RGB mode:</p>

	<section>
		<p>For the tl;dr: <a href="https://github.com/paultag/dockerfdw">Docker FDW</a> is a thing.
Star it, hack it, try it out. File bugs, be happy. If you want to see what it's
like to read, there's some example SQL down below.</p>
<aside class="left">
    This post was edited on Sep 21st to add information about the
    <code>DELETE</code> and <code>INSERT</code> operators
</aside>

<p>The question is first, what the heck is a PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrapper?
PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrappers are plugins that allow C libraries
to provide an adaptor for PostgreSQL to talk to an external database.</p>
<p>Some folks have used this to wrap stuff like
<a href="https://github.com/citusdata/mongo_fdw">MongoDB</a>, which I always found
to be hilarous (and an epic hack).</p>
<h1>Enter Multicorn</h1>
<p>During my time at <a href="http://pygotham.org/">PyGotham</a>, I saw a talk from 
<a href="https://twitter.com/weschow">Wes Chow</a> about something called
<a href="http://multicorn.org/">Multicorn</a>. He was showing off some really neat
plugins, such as the git revision history of CPython, and parsed logfiles
from some stuff over at Chartbeat. This basically blew my mind.</p>
<aside class="right">
    If you're interested in some of these, there are a bunch in the
    Multicorn VCS repo, such as the
    <a href="https://github.com/Kozea/Multicorn/blob/master/python/multicorn/gitfdw.py">gitfdw</a>
    example.
</aside>

<p>All throughout the talk I was coming up with all sorts of things that I wanted
to do -- this whole library is basically exactly what I've been dreaming
about for years. I've always wanted to provide a SQL-like interface
into querying API data, joining data cross-API using common crosswalks,
such as using <a href="http://capitolwords.org/">Capitol Words</a> to query for
Legislators, and use the
<a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/biosearch/biosearch.asp">bioguide ids</a>
to <code>JOIN</code> against the <a href="https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/">congress api</a>
to get their Twitter account names.</p>
<p>My first shot was to Multicorn the new
<a href="http://opencivicdata.org/">Open Civic Data</a> API I was working on, chuckled
and put it aside as a really awesome hack.</p>
<h1>Enter Docker</h1>
<p>It wasn't until <a href="https://github.com/tianon">tianon</a> connected the dots for me
and suggested a <a href="http://docker.io/">Docker</a> FDW did I get really excited.
Cue a few hours of hacking, and I'm proud to say -- here's
<a href="https://github.com/paultag/dockerfdw">Docker FDW</a>.</p>
<p>This lets us ask all sorts of really interesting questions out of the API,
and might even help folks writing webapps avoid adding too much Docker-aware
logic. Abstractions can be fun!</p>
<h1>Setting it up</h1>
<aside class="left">
    The only stumbling block you might find (at least on Debian and Ubuntu) is
    that you'll need a Multicorn `.deb`. It's currently undergoing an
    official Debianization from the Postgres team, but in the meantime I put
    the source and binary up on my
    <a href="https://people.debian.org/~paultag/tmp/">people.debian.org</a>.
    Feel free to use that while the Debian PostgreSQL team prepares the upload
    to unstable.
</aside>

<p>I'm going to assume you have a working Multicorn, PostgreSQL and Docker setup
(including adding the <code>postgres</code> user to the <code>docker</code> group)</p>
<p>So, now let's pop open a <code>psql</code> session. Create a database (I called mine
<code>dockerfdw</code>, but it can be anything), and let's create some tables.</p>
<p>Before we create the tables, we need to let PostgreSQL know where our
objects are. This takes a name for the <code>server</code>, and the <code>Python</code> importable
path to our FDW.</p>

<p>Now that we have the server in place, we can tell PostgreSQL to create a table
backed by the FDW by creating a foreign table. I won't go too much into the
syntax here, but you might also note that we pass in some options - these are
passed to the constructor of the FDW, letting us set stuff like the Docker
host.</p>

<p>And, now that we have tables in place, we can try to learn something about the

to images, showing all image tag names, the container names and the ip of the
container (if it has one!).</p>

<p>OK, let's see if we can bring this to the next level now. I finally got around
to implementing <code>INSERT</code> and <code>DELETE</code> operations, which turned out to be
pretty simple to do. Check this out:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">DELETE</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">docker_containers</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<div class="highlight"><pre>DELETE 1
</pre></div>


<p>This will do a <code>stop</code> + <code>kill</code> after a 10 second hang behind the scenes. It's
actually a lot of fun to spawn up a container and terminate it from
<code>PostgreSQL</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">INSERT</span> <span class="k">INTO</span> <span class="n">docker_containers</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">image</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">VALUES</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'hello'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'debian:unstable'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">RETURNING</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<div class="highlight"><pre>                                id                                
------------------------------------------------------------------
 0a903dcf5ae10ee1923064e25ab0f46e0debd513f54860beb44b2a187643ff05

INSERT 0 1
(1 row)
</pre></div>


<p>Spawning containers works too - this is still very immature and not super
practical, but I figure while I'm showing off, I might as well go all the way.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">ip</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">docker_containers</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'0a903dcf5ae10ee1923064e25ab0f46e0debd513f54860beb44b2a187643ff05'</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>


<div class="highlight"><pre>     ip      
-------------
 172.17.0.12
(1 row)
</pre></div>


<p>Success! This is just a taste of what's to come, so please feel free to hack on
<a href="https://github.com/paultag/dockerfdw">Docker FDW</a>,
tweet me <a href="http://twitter.com/paultag">@paultag</a>, file bugs / feature requests.
It's currently a bit of a hack, and it's something that I think has
long-term potential after some work goes into making sure that this is a rock
solid interface to the Docker API.</p>

	<h1>2014-09-16 23:51:31: <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/32369.html">ACPI, kernels and contracts with firmware</a> by mjg59 via <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/">Matthew Garrett</a></h1>
	<section>
		ACPI is a complicated specification - the <a href="http://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/ACPI_5_1release.pdf">latest version</a> is 980 pages long. But that's because it's trying to define something complicated: an entire interface for abstracting away hardware details and making it easier for an unmodified OS to boot diverse platforms.<br /><br />Inevitably, though, it can't define the full behaviour of an ACPI system. It doesn't explicitly state what should happen if you violate the spec, for instance. Obviously, in a just and fair world, no systems would violate the spec. But in the grim meathook future that we actually inhabit, systems do. We lack the technology to go back in time and retroactively prevent this, and so we're forced to deal with making these systems work.<br /><br />This ends up being a pain in the neck in the x86 world, but it could be much worse. Way back in 2008 I <a href="http://mjg59.livejournal.com/85923.html">wrote something</a> about why the Linux kernel reports itself to firmware as "Windows" but refuses to identify itself as Linux. The short version is that "Linux" doesn't actually identify the behaviour of the kernel in a meaningful way. "Linux" doesn't tell you whether the kernel can deal with buffers being passed when the spec says it should be a package. "Linux" doesn't tell you whether the OS knows how to deal with an HPET. "Linux" doesn't tell you whether the OS can reinitialise graphics hardware.<br /><br />Back then I was writing from the perspective of the firmware changing its behaviour in response to the OS, but it turns out that it's also relevant from the perspective of the OS changing its behaviour in response to the firmware. Windows 8 handles backlights differently to older versions. Firmware that's intended to support Windows 8 may expect this behaviour. If the OS tells the firmware that it's compatible with Windows 8, the OS has to behave compatibly with Windows 8.<br /><br />In essence, if the firmware asks for Windows 8 support and the OS says yes, the OS is forming a contract with the firmware that it will behave in a specific way. If Windows 8 allows certain spec violations, the OS must permit those violations. If Windows 8 makes certain ACPI calls in a certain order, the OS must make those calls in the same order. Any firmware bug that is triggered by the OS not behaving identically to Windows 8 must be dealt with by modifying the OS to behave like Windows 8.<br /><br />This sounds horrifying, but it's actually important. The existence of well-defined[1] OS behaviours means that the industry has something to target. Vendors test their hardware against Windows, and because Windows has consistent behaviour within a version[2] the vendors know that their machines won't suddenly stop working after an update. Linux benefits from this because we know that we can make hardware work as long as we're compatible with the Windows behaviour.<br /><br />That's fine for x86. But remember when I said it could be worse? What if there were a platform that Microsoft weren't targeting? A platform where Linux was the dominant OS? A platform where vendors all test their hardware against Linux and expect it to have a consistent ACPI implementation?<br /><br />Our even grimmer meathook future welcomes ARM to the ACPI world.<br /><br />Software development is <em>hard</em>, and firmware development is software development with worse compilers. Firmware is inevitably going to rely on undefined behaviour. It's going to make assumptions about ordering. It's going to mishandle some cases. And it's the operating system's job to handle that. On x86 we know that systems are tested against Windows, and so we simply implement that behaviour. On ARM, we don't have that convenient reference. We <em>are</em> the reference. And that means that systems will end up accidentally depending on Linux-specific behaviour. Which means that if we ever change that behaviour, those systems will break.<br /><br />So far we've resisted calls for Linux to provide a contract to the firmware in the way that Windows does, simply because there's been no need to - we can just implement the same contract as Windows. How are we going to manage this on ARM? The worst case scenario is that a system is tested against, say, Linux 3.19 and works fine. We make a change in 3.21 that breaks this system, but nobody notices at the time. Another system is tested against 3.21 and works fine. A few months later somebody finally notices that 3.21 broke their system and the change gets reverted, but oh no! Reverting it breaks the other system. What do we do now? The systems aren't telling us which behaviour they expect, so we're left with the prospect of adding machine-specific quirks. This isn't scalable.<br /><br />Supporting ACPI on ARM means developing a sense of discipline around ACPI development that we simply haven't had so far. If we want to avoid breaking systems we have two options:<br /><br />1) Commit to never modifying the ACPI behaviour of Linux.<br />2) Exposing an interface that indicates which well-defined ACPI behaviour a specific kernel implements, and bumping that whenever an incompatible change is made. Backward compatibility paths will be required if firmware only supports an older interface.<br /><br />(1) is unlikely to be practical, but (2) isn't a great deal easier. Somebody is going to need to take responsibility for tracking ACPI behaviour and incrementing the exported interface whenever it changes, and we need to know who that's going to be <em>before</em> any of these systems start shipping. The alternative is a sea of ARM devices that only run specific kernel versions, which is exactly the scenario that ACPI was supposed to be fixing.<br /><br />[1] Defined by implementation, not defined by specification<br />[2] Windows may change behaviour between versions, but always adds a new _OSI string when it does so. It can then modify its behaviour depending on whether the firmware knows about later versions of Windows.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=32369" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

that I hoped would make drawing on my computer less painful. That thing
is a Thinkpad X200, which is essentially a laptop with a Wacom tablet
glued to the screen. Like the models Lenovo has been pushing since
Windows 8 was released, It’s nice and easy to get the keyboard out of
the way when you just want to use the screen. They’ve actually been
building machines like this for a while however. I got this one
refurbished off of Ebay for around $200.</p>

		<p>So I’ve been missing blog posts off and on recently. I’ve decided to
give this blog a more specific theme: me trying to learn to draw. I’m
realizing I just don’t have something I want to write about every week,
and when I try to do so I end up producing a lot of filler. I’ve also
been slacking on the drawing thing, and I figure if I force myself to
publish something every week, I’ll be more inclined to put some serious
effort in - some of the drawings I’ve posted in the past are things I
wasn’t terribly proud of. Anyhow, here’s this week’s sketch:</p>

		<a href="http://alexose.com/photodump">Photodump</a> is an ultra-minimalist multiuser photo sharing application. &nbsp;It's fast, it's free, and it doesn't require a sign up.<br /><br /><a name="more"></a><br />This is a quick hack on <a href="http://firebase.io/">Firebase</a> that I've been playing with. &nbsp;There are a few interesting implementation details that you might find interesting:<br /><br />Thumbnails are first-class objects, for lack of a better term. &nbsp;When you upload a photo, Photodump will create a thumbnail on the client (using Canvas) and immediately sync that to the server. &nbsp;All connected users will instantly see the thumbnail while the full-size image downloads in the background.<br /><br />Firebase only deals in strings. &nbsp;And, firebase isn't really very good at big strings. &nbsp;In order to upload large images, I have to chunk them into 200k base64-encoded strings and upload one at a time. &nbsp;It's ugly, but it works.<br /><br />There are few features still in the works: &nbsp;Notably, caching using IndexedDB (I had it working with LocalStorage, but the limit is 5MB, so that wasn't going to work), and better handling of upload and download events.

	<section>
		<h1 id="retention---why-mooc-providers-cant-have-it-both-ways">Retention - Why MOOC providers can’t have it both ways</h1>

<p>MOOC antagonists have long used the dismal completion numbers as a sign that MOOCs don’t work. MOOC providers have countered that retention is an outdated concept that shouldn’t be applied to online courses. Neither are right. </p>

<p><em>Why we should not care about retention:</em> Retention is a very limited predictor of learning. It most reliably describes the students’ ability to stick with something they may or may not enjoy, or get value from. As such it might be a good indicator for grit, but not much more. </p>

<p><em>Why the MOOC providers have to care about retention:</em> Because you can’t have it both ways. If you believe in the format of courses, which you presumably do, if that’s what you offer (e.g. Coursera, edX, etc.), then retention has to be a key indicator for your success. Maybe the wrong people sign-up, or signing-up is just like highlighting something in the course catalog, but in both cases it is on you to improve your product. Make it harder to sign-up, or offer a highlight function that does’t register you for a course, or offer two levels of sign-up (a few years ago, P2PU experimented with the options to “follow” or “participate” and, as expected, more people chose to follow). Or move away from courses… </p>

<p>Judging from <a href="http://future.mit.edu/final-report">MIT’s recent report on the Future of Education</a> at least some of the key people are correctly shifting the focus of discussion from retention to the much more interesting question of how to design good learning experiences. The traditional course model will be only one option in the portfolio of answers. </p>

	<section>
		<h1 id="eating-in-boston">Eating in Boston</h1>

<p>A few personal favorites (I’ll try to keep the list updated). </p>

<p><strong>Island Creek Oyster Bar</strong> - Crowded, shi-shi, expensive, loud? Sure! But also the most consistently amazing oysters, raw bar and food. This is where I go when I want a great meal. Never disappoints. Getting a table can be a bit tricky (unless you are a regular). They take reservations but typically only for the early or late slots. Around 9:30 you can usually grab a seat at the bar. (Kenmore/Fenway)</p>

<p><strong>Alive and Kicking</strong> - Lobster shack. No frills. Outdoor seating. Great lobster sandwiches or steamed lobster. (Cambridgeport) </p>

<p><strong>Flour</strong> - Bakery with great lunch options. Cinnamon rolls are amazing. (Multiple locations, South End, Cambridge …) </p>

<p><strong>Render</strong> - Really good coffee, minus the attitude you encounter in (almost) every other good coffee shop in Boston. (South End) </p>

<p><strong>Row 34</strong> - Run by the same people as Island Creek Oyster Bar (see above). More industrial with slightly different menu in hip neighborhood. The food is just as awesome! (Fort Point Channel)</p>

<p><strong>Sportello</strong> - Have only been once, but loved the decor and food. Simple Italian dishes with an effortlessly cool vibe. (Fort Point Channel)</p>

<p><strong>Giulia</strong> - Amazing Italian in the Harvard area. Need to book (or come late and get an uncomfortable Bar seat, like me). (Harvard Sq)</p>

<p><strong>Toscanini</strong> - Late night ice cream spot. Good typography. The NYT’s quote in the window is BS. (Central Sq)</p>

<h1 id="things">Things</h1>

<p><strong>Red Sox</strong> - Do it! Eat a hot dog. Get a ridiculously overprized can of beer. Suffer in the tiny seats. It’s awesome. </p>

<p><strong>ICA</strong> - It’s not the MOMA NY, but great views into the harbor and some good art. </p>

<p><strong>MIT campus</strong> - Great buildings across the MIT campus. And what’s even better is that MIT has an open door policy. Almost all of the buildings are open during working hours (and many 24/7). Highlights include the old and new MIT Media Lab buildings, Frank Gehry’s STATA center, and the new student dorm in West Campus. </p>

<p><strong>Harvard Bridge/ Charles River</strong> - Slightly misleading name, this is actually the bridge that takes you to the MIT campus (first). On a nice day, walking around Charles river and crossing the bridge are two of my favorite things. </p>

	<h1>2014-07-23 06:37:21: <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/post/92607270174">My Email Vacation</a> by maggie.delano via <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/">Maggie Delano</a></h1>
	<section>
		<p>I spent the last 10 days or so on vacation. Before I left, I wrote <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/post/91414586934/a-real-vacation">this</a> post about trying to make my vacation as relaxing as possible, which for me involved banning myself from all but the most important e-mails.</p>
<p>To recap briefly, I told everyone who might need something from me before vacation that I&rsquo;d be gone, and did my best to tie up loose ends before hand. Then, I made all email skip my inbox, except emails that were sent directly to maggie.delano+vacation@gmail.com. I updated my autoresponder to inform people that I would not receive their email until my return unless they sent it to the above address. I deleted the gmail app from my phone, left my laptop at home, and went on vacation. Here&rsquo;s how it went:</p>
<p><strong>Email checking frequency:</strong> I found it incredibly tempting to check my email for the first 12 hours or so, but once I got to Portland, I only checked my email once or twice a day for relevant logistics emails from friends. When I arrived in SF, I had to reply to one work related email, but then everything else was logistics emails from friends. I found myself checking my email a bit more frequently when I knew a thread was actively going on, but nudged myself to stop checking so regularly once I picked up on the fact that I was doing this. In Vegas, I didn&rsquo;t check email too much, and when I realized that there were no more logistics to coordinate (and hence no more relevant emails to look out for), I stopped all together.</p>
<p><strong>Emails received: </strong>Everyone who needed to get in touch with me complied with my +vacation request. There wasn&rsquo;t a single email that I received when I got back that I needed to have responded to earlier, and only one important work thread that required the +vacation label at all. All other +vacation emails were trip logistics or from people I had &ldquo;whitelisted.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Phone usage</strong>: I found that once I had freed myself from my email, I used my phone a lot less. I realized that checking email/twitter are like tics for me, and are something I do immediately if I get a bit bored or stressed. Disconnecting made me feel a lot more present. I expected that I might just spend a lot of time on twitter or facebook, but I actually didn&rsquo;t go on twitter until half way through my trip, when I started to have more downtime and wanted to have things to talk about with people who weren&rsquo;t living in my vacation bubble. I checked facebook once during the week to approve friend requests, and then checked it a bunch in Vegas because people were posting photos of me. </p>
<p><strong>Cheating</strong>: All emails were labelled &ldquo;ruinyourvacation.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t check that label until I got home, which I&rsquo;m pretty happy about. I did, however, check my sent messages twice to make sure my emails were sent over the gmail web interface, and saw the contents of a few of my &ldquo;sent&rdquo; autoresponder messages. These didn&rsquo;t really give me a sense of the email contents, though.</p>
<p><strong>Coming back</strong>: I had about 500 email threads to sort through after I got back. I deleted all mailing list spam first (and unsubscribed from things while I was at it). This brought me down to about 300 threads. Then I went through the emails that were left, archived the ones I didn&rsquo;t need to reply to, and created filters for those types of emails to skip my inbox in the future. Finally, I went through and replied to emails that I needed to. This only added up to about 15 emails.</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong>: My vacation was incredibly relaxing, and I&rsquo;m really glad I made the decision to spare myself the contents of my inbox. Having a break from keeping track of so many things at once was really, really nice. It felt amazing to go about my day relatively worry-free. I joked that the only downside of my &ldquo;urgent only&rdquo; email policy was that it didn&rsquo;t also apply to my text messages. There were a few times when people texted me about things that weren&rsquo;t urgent and stressed me out a bit, which is one potential downside of taking a vacation &ldquo;on the grid,&rdquo; rather than off it.</p>
<p><strong>Moving forward: </strong>I&rsquo;m definitely going to implement an email vacation again. I&rsquo;m also considering implementing mini-vacations over the weekends. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the mobile vs. PC use cases for checking email, and am experimenting with enabling push notifications for &ldquo;important&rdquo; emails on my phone so that I&rsquo;m notified when an email I&rsquo;m waiting for comes in, rather than refreshing my inbox constantly. I&rsquo;d also like a more permanent solution like my +vacation filter so that I can toggle on which types of email I receive over weekends or breaks (my work and personal email separation is pretty poor as I used my @mit.edu address as my main address for many years before getting a gmail.com address). Will report back on how that all goes.</p>

	<section>
		<p>I wrote a thing for the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/open-source-madness">EFF Deeplinks blog</a>! Cross-posting it here.<span><br /></span></p>
<p>The Yorba Foundation, a non-profit group that produces open source Linux desktop software, reported last week that it was <a href="http://yorba.org/docs/IRS-determination-letter-final.pdf">denied tax-exempt 501&copy;(3) status by the IRS</a>. The group had waited nearly five years for a decision. The IRS stated that, because the software Yorba develops can be used commercially, the organization has a substantial non-exempt purpose and is disqualified from tax-exempt status. We think the IRS’ decision rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of open source software.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>This decision comes against the backdrop of previous “be on the look out” (BOLO) orders for open source software organizations’ applications for 501&copy;(3) status.  BOLOs were at the heart of the <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/irs-also-targeted-groups-labeled-themselves-progressive">controversy</a> over increased scrutiny of progressive and Tea Party organizations. A Mother Jones reader <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/06/revealed-why-irs-targeting-open-source-software-groups">theorized</a> that the IRS’s concerns might stem from debates during the 1970s and 1980s about whether computer user groups should count as non-profits. Perhaps so, but that’s no excuse for a five-year delay.</p>
<p>As Bradley Kuhn from the Software Freedom Conservancy noted in a <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/06/irs-open-sourc/">2013 Wired article</a>, some open source projects that primarily work on commercial products aren’t actually a good fit for 501&copy;(3) status and “[the IRS] has trouble making the distinction.” In fact, in its June 23rd 2010 letter to Yorba, the IRS asked directly: “Please explain how the activities of this organization differ from a commercial software development company beside distributing the software for free.”</p>
<p>Open source software organizations applying for tax-exempt 501&copy;(3) status have to show that they are organized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific or educational purposes. Unfortunately, these narrow buckets don’t necessarily correspond to the important work that some free and open source software (FOSS) organizations do.</p>
<p>Many FOSS projects have direct educational impacts. <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/about/">The Raspberry Pi Foundation</a>, out of the United Kingdom, was formed directly to address the declining number of students interested in computer science.  The GNOME Foundation, which is a 501&copy;(3) organization, funds an <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen">outreach program for women</a> interested in open source software. But organizations like Yorba directly fund software production as opposed to educational programming, and that makes them a harder fit for 501&copy;(3) status.</p>
<p>Just as a project might reject code that doesn’t conform to its standards, even if the code is well written, the IRS is bound by a narrow set of restrictions that it has previous interpreted. Journalism start-ups have faced <a href="http://www.dmlp.org/irs">similar problems</a> – while clearly their work benefits the public, it may not fully be charitable or educational, and thus may not be eligible for 501&copy;(3) status.</p>
<p>Still, the IRS’s denial demonstrates a lack of understanding of the open source movement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[The Yorba Foundation has] a substantial nonexempt purpose because [it] develop[s] software published under open source compatible licenses that authorize use by any person for any purpose, including nonexempt purposes such as commercial, recreational, or personal purposes, including campaign intervention and lobbying.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Jim Nelson said in <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/jnelson/2014/06/30/the-new-501c3-and-the-future-of-free-software-in-the-united-states/">his post about the denial</a>, these objections clash with three of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Four Software Freedoms</a>: the freedom to run the program as you wish, the freedom to redistribute copies, and the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions. That’s the benefit of permissive licensing.  Although the IRS’s concerns about laundering money through non-profits to avoid taxes are reasonable, those should not stand in the way of legitimate open source software organizations.</p>
<p>Additionally, five years is a ridiculous length of time to sit on an application. The Yorba Foundation heard nothing from the IRS between October 2011 and July 2014. Although efforts are being made to <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/New-1023-EZ-Form-Makes-Applying-for-501c3Tax-Exempt-Status-Easier-Most-Charities-Qualify">streamline this process</a> via providing a new, easier form, the IRS still has 60,000 pending applications. 501&copy;(3) status is often vital for organizations that are looking to use grant money or have larger donors. Although individual small donors may not be worried about the tax deduction, foundations and large donors often won’t work with non-501&copy;(3)s. We hope that the new simplified form will help cut down the number of organizations stuck in limbo.</p>
<p>It may be that not every open source project is a good fit for 501&copy;(3) status. However, the IRS’ position that the production of software is a “commercial activity” and that otherwise exempt organizations may be disqualified based on potential uses of their software by third parties is too inflexible and risks causing worthy non-profits to lose out on 501&copy;(3) status.</p>

	<section>
		<p>Grad school has been particularly stressful and hectic the past few months, so I&rsquo;m super excited to be taking a 10 day vacation starting tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll be flying to Portland, then to SF, then to Las Vegas, and then back home to Boston!</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve been planning for my vacation, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what it means to take a &ldquo;real&rdquo; vacation. What do I need to do for myself to properly de-stress?</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed about myself is that checking email on vacation almost always winds up stressing me out. One frustrating email request or grade report, and I can get bent out of shape for the rest of the day when I&rsquo;m supposed to be relaxing and enjoying myself.</p>
<p>I want this vacation to be different.</p>
<p>In an effort to allow myself to truly decompress, I&rsquo;ve decided to pledge to check my email as infrequently as possible. And when I do check it, I&rsquo;ll only check it for specific things like coordinating logistics with friends. I&rsquo;m also leaving my laptop at home so I don&rsquo;t get tempted to do any work or check my email.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve gotten closer to actually taking the vacation, I&rsquo;ve been feeling nervous about <em>actually</em> committing to not checking my email. So I&rsquo;ve been planning out how to make this pledge a reality.</p>
<p>Inspired by danah boyd&rsquo;s article on <a href="http://web.mit.edu/maggied/www/resume_mkd.pdf">How To Take An Email Sabbatical</a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5836537/the-most-cleverest-vacation-auto-reply-e-mail-ive-seen">this</a> clever autoresponder message, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done:</p>
<p><strong>Action Items and Collaborators:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Made a clear list of everything I&rsquo;m working on and identified concrete milestones to complete before vacation.</li>
<li>Completed those milestones as best as I could and sent a status update to anyone else involved.</li>
<li>Told anyone I&rsquo;m working on something with that I would be away on vacation starting a few weeks ago and that if they need anything from me, they should ask me before I leave.</li>
<li>Roughly planned out what I want to do the week I get back and set a few reminders for myself, so I don&rsquo;t feel totally swamped and stressed right after vacation.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Travel Logistics:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Told anyone I think might need to contact me (such as people I&rsquo;m meeting up with while traveling), that they should include maggie.delano+vacation@gmail.com on an email thread, and I&rsquo;ll respond to their messages.</li>
<li>Signed up for auto check-in for my flights and downloaded the United app to my phone so I have all my travel information accessible. </li>
<li>Made a note in Evernote with all relevant addresses and confirmation numbers, so I don&rsquo;t need to look them up in email and be tempted to break the pledge.</li>
</ul><p><strong>In Gmail:</strong></p>
<ul><li><span><span>Created a filter than applies the label &ldquo;ruinyourvacation&rdquo; to all incoming email and skips the inbox.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span></span></span>Created a filter that applies the label &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; to any email sent to maggie.delano+vacation@gmail.com.</li>
<li>Whitelisted a few specific email addresses.</li>
<li><span>Enabled my autoresponder with a message that explains I&rsquo;m on vacation, and to re-send the email to me only if it&rsquo;s urgent, or there&rsquo;s a good reason I need to see it (e.g. group logistics threads).</span></li>
<li><span>Pre-applied the &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; label to existing logistics threads, in case I need to refer to them or forgot to put something on my Evernote note.</span></li>
<li><span>Deleted the Gmail application from my phone.</span></li>
</ul><p><span>Despite all this effort, I&rsquo;ve still checked my email at least three times while writing this post. I think this will be a real challenge, but I&rsquo;m interested to see where it goes. I&rsquo;ll report back when I get home.</span></p>

<p>I got my Dell XPS13. Amazing.</p>

<p>The good news: This MacBook Air clone is <b>clearly</b> an Air competitor, and easily slightly better in nearly every regard except for the battery.</p>

<p><br />
The bad news is that the Intel Wireless card needs non-free (I&rsquo;ll be replacing that shortly), and the touchpad&rsquo;s driver isn&rsquo;t totally implemented until Kernel 3.16. I&rsquo;m currently building a 3.14 kernel with the patch to send to the kind Debian kernel people. We&rsquo;ll see if that works. Ubuntu Trusty already has the patch, but it didn&rsquo;t get upstreamed. That kinda sucks.</p>

<p>It also shipped with UEFI disabled, and was defaulting to boot in &lsquo;legacy&rsquo; mode. It shipped with Ubuntu, a bit disappointed to not see Ubuntu keys on the machine.</p>

<p>Touchscreen works; in short -stunning. I think I found my new travel buddy. Debian unstable runs great, stable had some issues.</p>

	<section>
		The security model on the Google Nexus devices is pretty straightforward. The OS is (nominally) secure and prevents anything from accessing the raw MTD devices. The bootloader will only allow the user to write to partitions if it's unlocked. The recovery image will only permit you to install images that are signed with a trusted key. In combination, these facts mean that it's impossible for an attacker to modify the OS image without unlocking the bootloader[1], and unlocking the bootloader wipes all your data. You'll probably notice that.<br /><br />The problem comes when you want to run something other than the stock Google images. Step number one for basically all of these is "Unlock your bootloader", which is fair enough. Step number two is "Install a new recovery image", which is also reasonable in that the key database is stored in the recovery image and so there's no way to update it without doing so. Except, unfortunately, basically every third party Android image is either unsigned or is signed with the (publicly available) Android test keys, so this new recovery image will flash anything. Feel free to relock your bootloader - the recovery image will still happily overwrite your OS.<br /><br />This is unfortunate. Even if you've encrypted your phone, anyone with physical access can simply reboot into recovery and reflash /system with something that'll stash your encryption key and mail your data to the NSA. Surely there's a better way of doing this?<br /><br />Thankfully, there is. Kind of. It's annoying and involves a bunch of manual processes and you'll need to re-sign every update yourself. But it is possible to configure Nexus devices in such a way that you retain the same level of security you had when you were using the Google keys without losing the freedom to run whatever you want. Here's how.<br /><br />Note: This is not straightforward. If you're not an experienced developer, you shouldn't attempt this. I'm documenting this so people can create more user-friendly approaches.<br /><br />First: Unlock your bootloader. /data will be wiped.<br />Second: Get a copy of the stock recovery.img for your device. You can get it from the factory images available <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images">here</a><br />Third: Grab mkbootimg from <a href="https://github.com/osm0sis/mkbootimg">here</a> and build it. Run unpackbootimg against recovery.img.<br />Fourth: Generate some keys. Get <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/android/platform_development/master/tools/make_key">this script</a> and run it.<br />Fifth: zcat recovery.img-ramdisk.gz | cpio -id to extract your recovery image ramdisk. Do this in an otherwise empty directory.<br />Sixth: Get DumpPublicKey.java from <a href="https://github.com/android/platform_system_core/blob/master/libmincrypt/tools/DumpPublicKey.java">here</a> and run it against the .x509.pem file generated in step 4. Replace /res/keys from the recover image ramdisk with the output. Include the "v2" bit at the beginning.<br />Seventh: Repack the ramdisk image (find . | cpio -o -H newc | gzip &gt; ../recovery.img-ramdisk.gz) and rebuild recovery.img with mkbootimg.<br />Eighth: Write the new recovery image to your device<br />Ninth: Get signapk from <a href="https://github.com/android/platform_build/tree/master/tools/signapk">here</a> and build it. Run it against the ROM you want to sign, using the keys you generated earlier. Make sure you use the -w option to sign the whole zip rather than signing individual files.<br />Tenth: Relock your bootloader<br />Eleventh: Boot into recovery mode and sideload your newly signed image.<br /><br />At this point you'll want to set a reasonable security policy on the image (eg, if it grants root access, ensure that it requires a PIN or something), but otherwise you're set - the recovery image can't be overwritten without unlocking the bootloader and wiping all your data, and the recovery image will only write images that are signed with your key. For obvious reasons, keep the key safe.<br /><br />This, well. It's obviously an excessively convoluted workflow. A *lot* of it could be avoided by providing a standardised mechanism for key management. One approach would be to add a new fastboot command for modifying the key database, and only permit this to be run when the bootloader is unlocked. The workflow would then be something like <ul><li>Unlock bootloader<li>Generate keys<li>Install new key<li>Lock bootloader<li>Sign image<li>Install image</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul> which seems more straightforward. Long term, individual projects could do the signing themselves and distribute their public keys, resulting in the install process becoming as easy as <ul><li>Unlock bootloader<li>Install ROM key<li>Lock bootloader<li>Install ROM</li></li></li></li></ul> which is actually <em>easier</em> than the current requirement to install an entirely new recovery image.<br /><br />I'd actually previously criticised Google on the grounds that using custom keys wasn't possible on Android devices. I was wrong. It is, it's just that (as far as I can tell) nobody's actually documented it before. It's important that users not be forced into treating security and freedom as mutually exclusive, and it's great that Google have made that possible.<br /><br />[1] This model fails if it's possible to gain root on the device. Thankfully this would never hold on what's that over there is that a distraction?<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=31765" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

	<section>
		<p>A few interesting things happened after I got a macbook air.
<br /><br />
Firstly, I got a lot of shit from my peers and friends about it. This was funny to me, nothing really bothered <b>me</b> about it, but I can see this becoming really tiresome at events like hackathons or conferences.
<br /><br />
As a byproduct, there&rsquo;s a strong feeling in the hardcore F/OSS world that Apple hardware is the incarnation of evil.
<br /><br />
As a result of both of the above, hardcore F/OSS (and Distro hackers) don&rsquo;t buy apple hardware.
<br /><br />
Therefore, GNU/Linux is complete garbage on Apple hardware. Apple&rsquo;s firmware bugs don&rsquo;t help, but we&rsquo;re <b>BAD</b>.
<br /><br />
Some might ask why this is a big deal. The fact is, this is one of the most used platforms for Open Source development (note I used that term exactly).
<br /><br />
Are we to damn these users to a nonfree OS because we want to maintain our purity?
<br /><br />
I had to give back my Air, but I still have a Mac Mini that i&rsquo;ve been using for testing bugs on OSX in code I have. Very soon, my Mac Mini will be used to help fix the common bugs in the install process.
<br /><br />
Some things you can do:

</p><ul><li>Consider not giving off an attitude to people with Apple hardware. Be welcoming.</li>
  <li>Consider helping with supporting your favorate distro on Apple hardware. Props to Fedora for doing such a great job, in particular, <a href="https://twitter.com/mjg59" target="_blank">mjg59</a> and <a href="http://blog.uncooperative.org/" target="_blank">Peter Jones</a> for all they do with it.</li>
  <li>Help me make Debian Apple installs one-click.</li>

	<section>
		<h1 id="disruption-disrupted">Disruption disrupted?</h1>

<p>It was a big week for disruption. Jill Lepore’s widely tweeted and read <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/06/23/140623fa_fact_lepore?currentPage=all">piece in the New Yorker</a> argued that as a theory “disruptive innovation” lacks predictive power, and that Clayton Christensen ignored a lot of the facts in the case-studies it is based on. That’s a pretty strong accusation. The anti-disruption crowd popped champagne corks and started the celebrations, and a part of me was happy that finally there was a counter-point to the pervasive rhetoric on disruption. </p>

<p>However, it is a counter-point to the <strong>rhetoric</strong> and not to the theory. And after reading more <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/06/23/clayton_christensen_jill_lepore_agree_disruptive_innovation_has_become_a.html">articles</a> including the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-20/clayton-christensen-responds-to-new-yorker-takedown-of-disruptive-innovation#p1">notes from an impromptu interview with Christensen himself</a> I feel like I don’t have enough of the facts to judge the merits of the case-studies, and I am less confident that Jill Lepore really does either. </p>

<p>In my personal experience, trying to make changes and develop new “innovative” solutions, doesn’t work in large institutions. There is too much inertia, too much “this is the way we’ve always done it” and too much fear to lose the current customers. When I worked at BMG Entertainment in the mid 90s, I remember attending a conference on technology and the music industry, where everyone just pretended nothing would change. Then Napster happened. And then iTunes. And now Spotify. I’m not taking sides here, but to pretend that the Internet has not completely disrupted the music industry is foolish. And the same effect can be seen in other fields that rely on extracting value from content, like news, or textbooks. </p>

<p>When we started <a href="http://p2pu.org">Peer 2 Peer University/P2PU</a> I tried to convince the University I worked for at the time to let me host it there. They declined. The idea of letting <em>anyone</em> get involved in facilitating and offering online courses was considered to dangerous for the reputation of the institution. Since then a lot has happened in the way we learn online. Stack Overflow is the de facto training ground for software developers and Khan Academy (and many similar efforts) have proven that high-quality learning content can effectively be produced by “amateurs”.  </p>

<p>The real problem is that “disruption” has become the defense and guise for unethical business practices. It was never intended this way, and it is unfair to blame Christensen for the misdeeds of business people, who would have just found some other slogan to use for exploiting others. </p>

<p>For what it’s worth, I met Christensen in person a few years ago, and found him genuine and truly interested in understanding the process of innovation. And I admit I’m easily influenced by my gut feeling ;-)</p>

	<section>
		<p>One which ends in tears, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>

<p>A week or so ago, I got an MacBook Air 13&quot; (MacBook Air 6-2), to take with me when I head out to local hack sessions, and when I travel out of state for short lengths of time. My current Thinkpad T520i is an amazing machine, and will remain my daily driver for a while to come.</p>

<p>After getting it, I unboxed the machine, and put in a Debian install USB key. I wiped OSX (without even booting into it) and put Debian on the drive.</p>

<p>To my dismay, it didn&rsquo;t boot up after install. Using the recovery mode of the disk, I chrooted in and attempted an upgrade (to ensure I had an up-to-date GRUB). I couldn&rsquo;t dist-upgrade, the terminal went white. After C-c'ing the terminal, I saw something about systemd&rsquo;s sysvinit shim, so I manually did a purge of sysvinit and install of systemd.</p>

<p>I hear this has been resolved now. Thanks :)</p>

<p>My machine still wasn&rsquo;t booting, so I checked around. Turns out I needed to copy over the GRUB EFI blob to a different location to allow it to boot. After doing that, I could boot Debian whilst holding Alt.</p>

<p>After booting, things went great! Until I shut my lid. After that point, my screen was either 0% bright (absolutely dark) or 100% (facemeltingly bright).</p>

<p>I saw <a href="https://github.com/patjak/mba6x_bl" target="_blank">mba6x_bl</a>, which claims to fix it, and has many happy users. If you&rsquo;re in a similar suggestion, I highly suggest looking at it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this caused my machine to black out on boot and I couldn&rsquo;t see the screen at all anymore. A rescue disk later, and I was back.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, the bootup noise&rsquo;s volume is stored in NVRAM, which gets written out by OSX when it shuts down. After consulting the inimitable<a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/" target="_blank">Matthew Garrett</a>, I was told the NVRAM can be hacked about with by mounting <code>efivarfs on /sys/firmware/efi/efivars type efivarfs</code>. Win!</p>

<p>After hitting enter, I got a kernel panic and some notes about hardware assertions failing.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when I returned my MacBook and got a Dell XPS 13.</p>

<p><br />
This is a problem, folks.</p>

<p>If <b>I</b> can&rsquo;t figure out how to make this work, how can we expect our users?</p>

<p>Such a shame the most hardware on the planet gets no support, locking it&rsquo;s users into even less freedom.</p>

I was at work until very late tonight. I had to take a cab home, because the train had stopped running. This wouldn't be a big deal, because it's normally only $15 with tip and takes less than 10 minutes. Unless the city decides to close all of the tunnel entrances simultaneously -- something I haven't seen in my 3.3 years living in East Boston. Often one is closed late at night, but I've never seen 3 closed before. $40 and 30 minutes later, I finally got home. I wish they announced the closures somewhere, but I really think they just do what they want when they want.

<ul><li><strong><a href="http://bloc11.com/menu/sandwiches/">The Atticus</a> at Bloc 11 Cafe</strong> <strong>- </strong>buffalo tempeh with avocado spread, tomato, red onion, and greens on rye. I tried this for the first time two weeks ago, and love it. Ask for it toasted.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.cloverfoodlab.com/food/">Chickpea Fritter</a> at Clover</strong> - hummus, israeli salad, pickles, falafel, pickled vegetables and tahini. Crunchy and amazing. </li>
<li><strong>Chana Masala and Toor Dal at <a href="http://dining.mit.edu/venues-menus/cafespice">Cafe Spice</a></strong> - chickpeas, yellow lentils, and rice. Simple but probably one of my favorite lunch time options.</li>

	<h1>2014-06-23 01:00:00: <a href="http://1l2p.net/2014/06/23/Adult-Learning.html">Connecting Adult Learners</a> by 1L2P via <a href="http://1l2p.net/">Philipp Schmidt</a></h1>
	<section>
		<p><em>I wrote this post for the DML Central blog. Please leave comments at <a href="http://dmlcentral.net/blog/philipp-schmidt/connecting-adult-learners">DML Central</a> if you’d like to join the conversation.</em></p>

<p>A lot of the work we have been doing as part of the connected learning community has focused on children and young people. We design digital tools that create new ways for young people to learn. We create environments in which learning starts with a young person’s interest. And, we are starting to re-design the academic system so that “non-traditional” learning can find the recognition it deserves.</p>

<p>There are many good reasons why we have focused on young people. It’s easier to make a difference to someone’s life if they are just starting out, if they haven’t already fallen behind because they lack access to good schools or other opportunities. And, as everyone who works with children will confirm, it is also very rewarding. Seeing how your work makes a young person’s eyes light up is a wonderful experience. Working with adult learners on the other hand is often harder, messier, and less likely to succeed. But, there are at least two reasons why it is important.</p>

<p>There are too many adults with low skills in the U.S. to ignore. The PIAAC study (the PISA study’s less famous adult cousin) finds that at least 36 million U.S. Americans score in the lowest two categories of literacy and maths (PDF). Many have fallen out of the traditional academic systems. If connected learning can offer learners better ways to connect life and learning, and translate achievements outside the academic environment, into real world benefits, then this is a group that urgently needs it.</p>

<p>Helping adults move toward family-supporting employment, might create more opportunities for their kids to become connected learners in the future. We have made great strides designing technologies that are more accessible and appropriate for learners from diverse backgrounds. And, researchers like Ricarose Roque at the MIT Media Lab are involving families to create more supportive learning environments especially for children from low-income backgrounds. We are making progress, but on the whole, children are more likely to pick up tools like Scratch or Minecraft if they come from an opportunity-rich background. And, learning opportunities increase with income — wealthier families not only spend more money on their kids’ learning, but their kids also spend more time in places like museums and after-school programs. So why not use connected learning to increase income?</p>

<p>As part of a new initiative titled “Making / Learning / Work” (in collaboration with the Joyce Foundation) at the MIT Media Lab, we’ve started reaching out to adult learners, employers, training providers, and to the technology innovators of the Media Lab, to come up with some new solutions for adult learners. During our kick-off workshop, we sketched out 14 project ideas and are currently in the process of refining them in order to pick two or three for implementation. In the process, we are finding that connected learning works not just for kids, but also for adults. Interests may be different (think welding rather than wrestling), but having a clear purpose is just as crucial. And, peer support maybe more important yet. Many of the adult learners we are looking at have had unsuccessful experiences with the education system. Having a community they can turn to, connecting with peers who have struggled with similar challenges, and taking the role of mentor as well as mentee, could make all the difference between dropping out and pulling through. Finally, turning real world experiences into academic achievements is necessary in order to turn them into jobs.</p>

<p>Over the next 18 months, we’ll be refining our ideas, developing prototypes, and iterating on the design in close collaboration with the adult learners we are trying to support. If others in the DML Central community are interested in this area, and would like to learn more, please don’t hesitate to get in touch. We are always interested in finding more collaborators.</p>

	<section>
		<p>This week, I started work on something I&rsquo;m calling <a href="https://github.com/paultag/moxie" target="_blank">moxie</a>. Due to wanting to use my <a href="https://github.com/paultag/aiodocker" target="_blank">aiodocker</a> bindings on the backend, I decided to implement it in 100% AsyncIO Python 3.4.</p>

<p>What pushed me over the edge was finding the <a href="http://aiopg.readthedocs.org/en/0.2/" target="_blank">aiopg</a> driver (postgres asyncio bindings), with very (let me stress - <b>very</b>) immature SQLAlchemy support.<br /><br />
Unfortunately, no web frameworks support asyncio as a first-class member of the framework, so I was forced into writing a microframework. The resulting &ldquo;app&rdquo; looks <a href="https://github.com/paultag/moxie/blob/master/moxie/app.py" target="_blank">pretty not bad</a>, and likely easy to switch if Flask ever gets support for asyncio.</p>

<p>One neat side-effect was that the framework can support stuff like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket" target="_blank">websockets</a> as a first-class element of the framework, just like <code>GET</code> requests.</p>

<p>Moxie will be a tool to run periodic long-running jobs in a sane way using <a href="http://docker.io/" target="_blank">docker.io</a>.</p>

<p>More soon!</p>

		<p>I'm working on a project to cook every recipe and major variation in

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/156924264X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=156924264X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wjsullivannet-20">Veganomicon</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wjsullivannet-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=156924264X" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />.

</p>

<p>Since the <a href="http://journal.wjsullivan.net/297506.html">last post about this</a>, I made:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Dijonaise</strong>: was okay, after reducing the sweetener from 2 tbsp to 2 tsp. I'm not a huge fan of these silken tofu based dressings &mdash; they taste too much like soy. And probably I should have used a spicier dijon than the Maille &mdash; I added more than called for, anyway. And I need to cut the whole thing in half because there is no way I can finish it before it goes bad. And I need to plan to use silken tofu for multiple things at once because I've never figured out how to preserve it properly in the fridge once open for any length of time.</li>

<li><strong>Tomato rice soup with roasted garlic and navy beans:</strong> I cooked the navy beans from dry instead of using canned &mdash; so easy with the pressure cooker. The roasted garlic instructions were wrong. The soup recipe says to preheat the oven to 425 and then roast for 45 minutes according to instructions on page 32. But page 32 says preheat to 375 and roast for 20-30. I followed the latter, with an extra 8 minutes with the garlic uncovered. The soup was very good, but I'll use less marjoram next time.</li>

<li><strong>Marinated Asian tofu</strong>: Nice quick way to prepare tofu. I cooked down the marinade to make a sauce for it, but probably should have added some thickener.</li>

<li><strong>Collard green rolls with blackeyed peas:</strong> Very good. No way you can do with just one bunch collards though, like the recipe says. I used two. There's kind of a temperature problem in the finished dish because the outside wrap is inevitably cold. Maybe they could be warmed back up in a steamer basket after rolling before serving.</li>

<li><strong>Backyard BBQ sauce:</strong> Goes with the collard green rolls. Very good. I like a thick bbq sauce, so this recipe didn't make enough to have very much on top of the rolls in the end. But I also didn't think the rolls needed much (any) on top. I also ate it on a Boca burger and some Gardein chicken nuggets.</li>

<li><strong>Banana wheat germ muffins:</strong> Mmmmm, don't they sound hippielicious? But they are good. I was wary about the amount of cinnamon, as I'm not always the biggest fan, but it wasn't too much. They took 2 minutes longer than the recipe, in my oven.</li>

<li><strong>Lower-fat banana bread:</strong> There's a small screw-up in the recipe; the directions mention optional chocolate chips but those are not in the ingredient list. I screwed it up too, and only put half the sugar in &mdash; that's what I get for baking before coffee. It was still good, though.</li>

<li><strong>Fresh dill-basmati rice with chard and chickpeas:</strong> Little typo in the recipe, &quot;the it&quot;. Tasty. Kind of begging for a yogurty sauce drizzled over it, I think. I think the lowest cooking time was still a little long, but maybe I just had the heat too high.</li>

<li><strong>Sweet Vidalia onion sauce:</strong> Boston Organics has been burying me in beautiful Vidalia onions the last few weeks. I love caramelized onions, but this recipe was pretty bad on that front. It takes longer than 20 minutes to caramelize onions &mdash; more like 40+. Also, there's no way this makes 2 cups of sauce as claimed, since it only specifies 2 cups of onions to start with. They reduce to about 25% of their size. It's more like a relish than a sauce. I also don't think 30 seconds is enough after adding the liquid ingredients &mdash; unless you want to serve a cold sauce. I turned the heat up to medium-high, brought it just to a simmer, then took it off right away. All issues aside, it's delicious. But if someone had never caramelized onions before and followed this recipe, they'd end up with grossness.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Inspired Vegan</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Vinaigrette:</strong> I used this recipe several times in the last few weeks. I switched to using grapeseed oil with it, because I just don't like that strong of an olive oil flavor in my vinaigrette &mdash; maybe I should try half-and-half. With all olive oil, it was also too thick &mdash; probably because I use a stick blender to whisk it, which generally reduces the amount of oil required for an emulsion.</li>

	<section>
		<p>After last year&rsquo;s book project, anything I do this year will pale in comparison. But I am keeping track of my reading on Goodreads, and have a spreadsheet with some information about the authors I&rsquo;m reading.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/c4ed03d85344713504638572867547a8/tumblr_inline_n78salFK1F1rrgb56.png" /></p>
<p>(Picture of books I&rsquo;ve read so far this year.)</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>Things I&rsquo;m tracking this year:</p>
<ul><li><span>Author gender (male/female/other) - I still find this useful, although I felt that just using M/F was less inclusive than I wanted to be.</span></li>
<li><span>Whether author is a person of color - Super non-granular, but still helpful.</span></li>
<li><span>Whether the author is queer - If a brief google search can find out for me, at least. I didn&rsquo;t track this last year and wished I had.</span></li>
<li><span>Whether the book is a translation - Usually a proxy for non-Western literature, but not always.</span></li>
<li><span>Whether the book is fiction - Turns out I read mostly non-fiction and still think it&rsquo;s pretty even notice.</span></li>
<li><span>Why I read it (recommendation from a friend/bookclub/school/other) - Attempting to figure out where books I read come from.</span></li>
<li><span>Book format (Kindle/Physical/Other) - Didn&rsquo;t track it last year, wished I had.</span></li>
</ul><p>Interesting takeaways so far: most of the reading I&rsquo;ve done has been from bookclubs - setting deadlines helped me get through books in school. And most of the reading has been on a Kindle - mostly because I read a lot while commuting and a Kindle is way easier to pull out on the train.</p>
<p>More to come, certainly. But that&rsquo;s the plan for this year - fewer books, more info. </p>

	<section>
		<p>I've been using <a href="https://linode.com">Linode</a> since 2010, and many of
my friends have heard me talk about how big a fan I am of linode. I've
used Debian unstable on all my Linodes, since I often use them as a remote
shell for general purpose Debian development. I've found my linodes to be
indispensable, and I really love Linode.</p>
<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>Recently, because of my work on <a href="http://docker.io/">Docker</a>, I was forced
to stop using the Linode kernel in favor of the stock Debian kernel, since
the stock Linode kernel has no aufs support, and the default LVM-based
devicemapper backend can be quite a pain.</p>
<aside class="left">
    The btrfs errors are ones I fully expect to be gone soon, I can't wait
    to switch back to using it.
</aside>

<p>I tried loading in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">btrfs</a> support, and
using that to host the Docker instance backed with btrfs, but it was throwing
errors as well. Stuck with unstable backends, I wanted to use the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufs">aufs</a> backend, which, dispite problems in
aufs internally, is quite stable with Docker (and in general).</p>
<p>I started to run through the <a href="https://library.linode.com/custom-instances/pv-grub-howto">Linode Library's guide on PV-Grub</a>,
but that resulted in a cryptic error with xen not understanding the compression
of the kernel. I checked for recent changes to the compresson, and lo, the
Debian kernel has been switched to use xz compression in sid. Awesome news,
really. XZ compression is awesome, and I've been super impressed with how
universally we've adopted it in Debian. Keep it up!  However, it appears only
a newer pv-grub than the Linode hosts have installed will fix this.</p>
<p>After contacting the (ever friendly) Linode support, they were unable to give
me a timeline on adding xz support, which would entail upgrading pv-grub. It
was quite disapointing news, to be honest. Workarounds were suggested,
but I'm not quite happy with them as proper solutions.</p>
<p>After asking in <code>#debian-kernel</code>, <a href="http://bblank.thinkmo.de/blog">waldi</a> was
able to give me a few pointers, and the following is very inspired by him,
the only thing that changed much was config tweaking, which was easy enough.
Thanks, Bastian!</p>
<h1>The Constraints</h1>
<p>I wanted to maintain a 100% stock configuration from the kernel up.
When I upgraded my kernel, I wanted to just work. I didn't want to
unpack and repack the kernel, and I didn't want to install software
outside main on my system. It had to be 100% Debian and unmodified.</p>
<h1>The Solution</h1>
<aside class="right">
    It's pretty fun to attach to the lish console and watch bootup pass
    through GRUB 0.9, to GRUB 2.x to Linux. Free Software, Fuck Yeah.
</aside>

<p>Left unable to run my own kernel directly in the Linode interface, the tact
here was to use Linode's old pv-grub to chain-load grub-xen, which loaded
a modern kernel. Turns out this works great.</p>
<p>Let's start by creating a config for Linode's pv-grub to read
and use.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo mkdir -p /boot/grub/
</pre></div>


<p>Now, since pv-grub is legacy grub, we can write out the following
config to chain-load in <code>grub-xen</code> (which is just Grub 2.0, as far as I can
tell) to <code>/boot/grub/menu.lst</code>. And to think, I almost forgot all about
<code>menu.lst</code>. Almost.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>default 1

timeout 3

title grub-xen shim
root (hd0)
kernel /boot/xen-shim
boot
</pre></div>


<p>Just like riding a bike! Now, let's install and set up grub-xen to work for us.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo apt-get install grub-xen
sudo update-grub
</pre></div>


<p>And, let's set the config for the GRUB image we'll create in the next step
in the <code>/boot/load.cf</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>configfile (xen/xvda)/boot/grub/grub.cfg
</pre></div>


<p>Now, lastly, let's generate the <code>/boot/xen-shim</code> file that we need
to boot to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>grub-mkimage --prefix <span class="s1">'(xen/xvda)/boot/grub'</span> -c /boot/load.cf -O x86_64-xen /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-xen/*.mod &gt; /boot/xen-shim
</pre></div>


<p>Next, change your boot configuration to use <code>pv-grub</code>, and give the machine
a kick. Should work great! If you run into issues, use the lish shell to
debug it, and let me know what else I should include in this post!</p>
<p>Hack on!</p>

	<section>
		<p>About a year ago, I wrote <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/post/52354508154/knowing-whats-important" target="_blank">this post</a> about identifying things that are important to me. Now that a year has passed, I&rsquo;d like to take the time to reflect both on what I wrote a year ago and how I&rsquo;ve been doing for the past year.</p>
<p>When I wrote my post a year ago, I was struggling to figure out what was important to me. I was lost and felt that I needed to search for more meaning in my life and be more deliberate about how I spend my time. While I certainly don&rsquo;t think I have everything completely sorted out today, I do feel much less lost now. I have a good sense of what is important to me, and I&rsquo;ve taken strides toward realizing some of the goals I laid out a year ago. </p>
<p>I broke the things I consider to be most important to me into the categories of <strong>self-improvement</strong>, <strong>meaningful work</strong>, and <strong>quality time with friends and family</strong>. I&rsquo;d say I still feel that way today. </p>
<p><strong>Self-Improvement:</strong></p>
<p>With self-improvement, I was specifically focused on health, productivity, and mindfulness.</p>
<ul><li><span><strong>Health</strong>: I set my health goals to be both &ldquo;not sick&rdquo; and &ldquo;in shape.&rdquo; I would say I&rsquo;ve done reasonably well on both of these goals. Some parts of the year were definitely much better than others. I have been eating well, including experimenting with <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/post/84796926874/reflections-after-a-month-of-veganism-during-the-week" target="_blank">a vegan during the week diet</a>. I also ran a number of races, including my first half marathon, and I&rsquo;m getting ready to train for my first full marathon in November.<br /></span></li>
<li><strong><span>Productivity: </span></strong><span>I did not have formal goals for this last year, but I would say that I have definitely accomplished a lot this year, both research-wise and in general. I became an official PhD candidate, and created a second revision system for my thesis this year. However, while I do have times of hyperfocus, I also have times where I&rsquo;m burned out and don&rsquo;t get much done.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Mindfulness: </strong>I&rsquo;ve done OK at being more mindful, but not great. I have been keeping up with my reading (although I am a little behind now) and I am blogging about once a week, but I definitely haven&rsquo;t spent enough time on myself and reflecting as I&rsquo;m realizing I need to be.</span></li>
</ul><p><span>I think I did OK in the area of self-improvement. There are concrete aspects that I think went really well at different times, but I definitely have found myself sacrificing being more productive in exchange for my health and my mindfulness.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Meaningful</span><span> work:</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p>With meaningful work, my goals for the past year were to focus specifically on research, building skills / learning, and community.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Research</strong>: I became a fully qualified PhD candidate this year, and am in the process of securing funding for the rest of my PhD. I&rsquo;m getting ready to write my formal thesis proposal, in which I will lay out my plans for graduation. All in all, I think I made a lot of progress on research this year, although I still need to push myself a bit to get the project clearly defined and move forward in the next few years.</li>
<li><strong>Building skills / learning: </strong>I&rsquo;ve been doing well at learning new things, including participating in a number of book clubs, and taking a course on <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/post/84087385647/readings-for-the-queer-soul">Queer Theory and Politics</a>. I have also gotten a lot more involved with the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> community and learned from a number of amazing people there. </li>
<li><strong>Community: </strong>I have done a lot more for community this year. I am a member of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCIQtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fprojects.csail.mit.edu%2Feecsrefs%2F&amp;ei=8H6WU4HvBsubyASn8oLQDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNExre6H0vzuNk8TrmdiwbKXqjgzAQ&amp;sig2=7MZamtqjsRP4o2aOk81ybQ&amp;bvm=bv.68445247,d.aWw&amp;cad=rja" target="_blank">EECS REFS</a> and was just accepted as a <a href="http://studentlife.mit.edu/reslifeanddining/rlp/graduate-resident-tutors" target="_blank">Graduate Residence Tutor</a> at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/senior-house/www/">Senior House</a>. I am now a co-organizer of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/">Boston Quantified Self</a>, and started <a href="http://www.meetup.com/QSXX-Quantified-Self-Womens-Meetup-Boston/">Boston&rsquo;s Quantified Self women&rsquo;s meetup group</a>. </li>
</ul><p>I think I did really well when it came to focusing on meaningful work. However, I think I&rsquo;m stretching myself thin on my involvement in community, and need to refocus my efforts on research now that I&rsquo;m getting closer to graduation in 2-3 years.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Time with Friends and Family:</strong></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t give myself a specific goal or metric for this category (I&rsquo;m thinking about what one might be, but I&rsquo;m not sure yet). In the past year, I&rsquo;ve made new connections and built relationships that are important to me. I started last summer in &ldquo;make all the friends possible&rdquo; mode and met a lot of new people. However, I&rsquo;ve struggled to build up these new relationships and to maintain existing ones. There have been a few people I&rsquo;ve drifted apart from because we don&rsquo;t fit well into each other&rsquo;s lives anymore, but more often than not I haven&rsquo;t maintained relationships with those I care about because I&rsquo;ve been too busy. </p>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>
<p>I think I came a long way in the past year as far as discovering more about myself and working on what is important to me. However, I&rsquo;d say that I succeeded most in working on what is meaningful to me at the cost of time for myself and for those I care about.</p>
<p>Last year, I felt I didn&rsquo;t have enough meaning in my life. I was reasonably happy with myself and my relationships, but struggled most with my work and needed a sense of purpose. Now, I think I overcompensated and am happy with more of my work, but feel like I&rsquo;ve committed to too much and need to step back and find some balance in my life. Everything I&rsquo;m working on feels meaningful and important, but I need to pare down so I can focus on doing a subset of things well, rather than a larger set of things suboptimally.</p>
<p><strong>Things to consider:</strong></p>
<p>Overall, I still identify with my main areas of self-improvement, meaningful work, and quality time and their associated sub-goals. Moving forward for the next year, here are a few things I&rsquo;m going to be more mindful of:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Long-term vs. short-term:</strong> meaning is important to find, but it also important to consider work that is meaningful in the short-term vs. work that is meaningful in the long-term. Short-term work keeps me motivated now, but long-term work is what I can point to after I graduate. I find that the short-term work I&rsquo;m doing is motivating for me, but can cause me to avoid dealing with the harder, but potentially more rewarding longer-term work. </li>
<li><strong>Few vs. many: </strong>Doing more work makes me feel that what I&rsquo;m working on has more meaning, but doing more work also means making less of an impact on each thing I do. Focus may be more important than diversity. </li>
<li><strong>Balance, not meaning: </strong>I did a good job at finding meaningful work, but at the cost of balance. This year I should focus more on balance and worry less about meaning: there is only so much I can do and rather than trying to do more things, I should focus on what I&rsquo;m already doing that has already a lot of meaning.</li>
</ul>

		<h1 id="im-interested-in-food">I’m interested in Food</h1>

<p>At the MIT Media Lab, there is a growing community of people interested in food and food related research.  My field of research is learning, specifically peer-to-peer learning online and I don’t do active research on food (but for a long time I’ve always played with the idea of changing that).</p>

<p>I’m interested in food along two dimensions. I think the act of preparing and consuming food is inextricably linked with human development. I love eating it and learning about it. I also think food is an important anchor of community. </p>

<p>When the Media Lab wellbeing initiative kicked off, I proposed to fund a small kitchen and a large table for communal lunches. The oldest Lab we know, the kitchen, should be better represented in our environment - and I think that cooking and eating together will have a lot of health benefits for the Lab community. </p>

<p>I recently came across this <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/lunch-at-the-shop-by-peter-miller-new-cookbook-201038">wonderful book about cooking simple lunches at work</a>, and would like to do something similar, maybe once a week, at the Lab. There is an urban farm one floor above me now and I am hoping we can use some of the fresh produce from the farmto “feed” the Media Lab lunch club.</p>

<p>I also co-host a <a href="http://eatersdigestwmbr.tumblr.com/">radio show about food on WMBR</a> (the MIT campus radio) where we interviews chefs about music, and musicians about food, and talk about all kinds of food related things. We also play music requests if you tweet using the #wmbrfood hashtag. </p>

	<section>
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been learning about android development over the last few weeks, and I think I&rsquo;m slowly getting the hang of best practices.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bit tough, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that&rsquo;s not super Java-idomatic that&rsquo;s become Android-idiomatic, so getting over that stuff has been interesting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been finding that Android tends to re-implement most things in a similar enough way, but always with some small tweak that feels kinda funny.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s working well enough, and I&rsquo;m hoping that I can clean up a few android libraries to deal with some of the OpenGov datasets I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>

<p>If anyone has any tips on proper handling of what to make a fragment, and what activities should look like, I&rsquo;d really love posts about that.</p>

<p>It seems like sometimes I have a 1-to-1 mapping of Fragments to Activity, but I want to keep it a fragment for large devices.</p>

<p>Anyway, best practices welcome.</p>

<p>A few personal favorites (I’ll try to keep the list updated)</p>

<p><strong>Restaurant 3</strong> - somewhat under the radar, simple and stylish, modern italian fare (my personal favorite in Berlin, highly recommended)</p>

<p><strong>Cafe Einstein (breakfast)</strong> - A return to cafe house culture. International newspapers. Good breakfast. Two locations (the old one is better). </p>

<p><strong>Bar Buck &amp; Breck</strong> (brunnenstr 177) - the best cocktail bar (in the world, maybe). tiny and hard to find. ring the door bell! when they are full, they are full (no waiting list). don’t go with more than 2 (max 3 people). </p>

<p><strong>Cookies &amp; Cream</strong> - expensive stylish vegetarian restaurant, that is attached to a house club. great location, and if you go on a club night, you can enter the party straight from the restaurant, skipping the line and bouncer.</p>

<p><strong>Bonanza Coffee Roasters</strong> - my favorite of the hipster coffee shops. These guys were the first, and they are still the best and nicest. I hate their competitors The Barn. </p>

		<p>
Please stop recommending that checking government-issued ID is a good way to verify someone's identity before signing their GPG key.
</p>

<p>
Have you been a US bartender before? Or held any other position where you've had to verify an ID? It's not an easy thing to do. People in those positions have books of valid IDs from different states. They have lights that show the security marks. They still get it wrong regularly. A very amateur fake ID, or borrowed real ID, will fool just about everyone in any informal context.
</p>

<p>
What's even worse is that people have a habit of happily looking at passports from other countries than their own, and nodding knowingly. It's fun, but be honest, you have no idea what you're doing.
</p>

<p>
How about just signing keys with people you would actually say you know well enough to trust? It's not the Web of Amateur ID Checking.
</p>

<p>
ID checking is at best ineffective against the threats it's supposed to address, and is probably actually damaging to the Web of Trust because of the false sense of security.

	<section>
		I was at the <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-atlanta-2014/">OpenStack Summit</a> this week. The overwhelming majority of OpenStack deployments are Linux-based, yet the most popular laptop vendor (by a long way) at the conference was Apple. People are writing code with the intention of deploying it on Linux, but they're doing so under an entirely different OS.<br /><br />But what's <em>really</em> interesting is the tools they're using to do so. When I looked over people's shoulders, I saw terminals and a web browser. They're not using Macs because their development tools require them, they're using Macs because of what else they get - an aesthetically pleasing OS, iTunes and what's easily the best trackpad hardware/driver combination on the market. These are people who work on the same laptop that they use at home. They'll use it when they're commuting, either for playing videos or for getting a head start so they can leave early. They use an Apple because they don't want to use different hardware for work and pleasure.<br /><br />The developers I was surrounded by aren't the same developers you'd find at a technical conference 10 years ago. They grew up in an era that's become increasingly focused on user experience, and the idea of migrating to Linux because it's more tweakable is no longer appealing. People who spend their working day making use of free software (and in many cases even contributing or maintaining free software) won't run a free software OS because doing so would require them to compromise on things that they care about. Linux would give them the same terminals and web browser, but Linux's poorer multitouch handling is enough on its own to disrupt their workflow. Moving to Linux would slow them down.<br /><br />But even if we fixed all those things, why would somebody migrate? The best we'd be offering is a comparable experience with the added freedom to modify more of their software. We can probably assume that this isn't a hugely compelling advantage, because otherwise it'd probably be enough to overcome some of the functional disparity. Perhaps we need to be looking at this differently.<br /><br />When we've been talking about developer experience we've tended to talk about the experience of people who are writing software targeted at our desktops, not people who are incidentally using Linux to do their development. These people don't need better API documentation. They don't need a nicer IDE. They need a desktop environment that gives them access to the services that they use on a daily basis. Right now if someone opens an issue against one of their bugs, they'll get an email. They'll have to click through that in order to get to a webpage that lets them indicate that they've accepted the bug. If they know that the bug's already fixed in another branch, they'll probably need to switch to github in order to find the commit that contains the bug number that fixed it, switch back to their issue tracker and then paste that in and mark it as a duplicate. It's tedious. It's annoying. It's distracting.<br /><br />If the desktop had built-in awareness of the issue tracker then they could be presented with relevant information and options without having to click through two separate applications. If git commits were locally indexed, the developer could find the relevant commit without having to move back to a web browser or open a new terminal to find the local checkout. A simple task that currently involves multiple context switches could be made significantly faster.<br /><br />That's a simple example. The problem goes deeper. The use of web services for managing various parts of the development process removes the need for companies to maintain their own infrastructure, but in the process it tends to force developers to bounce between multiple websites that have different UIs and no straightforward means of sharing information. Time is lost to this. It makes developers unhappy.<br /><br />A combination of improved desktop polish and spending effort on optimising developer workflows would stand a real chance of luring these developers away from OS X with the promise that they'd spend less time fighting web browsers, leaving them more time to get on with development. It would also help differentiate Linux from proprietary alternatives - Apple and Microsoft may spend significant amounts of effort on improving developer tooling, but they're mostly doing so for developers who are targeting their platforms. A desktop environment that made it easier to perform generic development would be a unique selling point.<br /><br />I spoke to various people about this during the Summit, and it was heartening to hear that there are people who are already thinking about this and hoping to improve things. I'm looking forward to that, but I also hope that there'll be wider interest in figuring out how we can make things easier for developers without compromising other users. It seems like an interesting challenge.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=31714" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

	<section>
		<p>Coaches in the NHL should be able to decline a penalty shot and take a 2:00 power play instead.</p>

<p>I thought of this tonight while watching Jonathan Quick in Game 7 stop Anaheim's penalty shot with a brilliant poke check. But I see that the idea was suggested a long time ago <a href="http://www.gretzky.com/blog/2009/01/declining-the-penalty-shot/">by Pierre McGuire.</a></p>

<p>There are enough possible game situations where the coach might rather have a power play than a penalty shot that they should be given the option. The penalty shot is meant to be the most severe penalty; but in some cases it may be less severe.</p>

<p>It seems hard to find stats about what the penalty shot save percentages are, but that article claims in one season 19 out of 64 went in, for a 29.6% scoring rate. That's league-wide; it would be more interesting to see the percentages of individual goaltenders, and individual scorers.</p>

<p>The best power plays in the league are just under 25%, but you can imagine particular situations where the expected percentage could be higher. The player going to the box may be one of the team's best penalty killers. The penalized team may have an especially bad kill percentage historically against the beneficiary team.</p>

<p>The penalty shot results in a single high-quality scoring chance. But, for most calls, the player who takes it has to be the one who was fouled. This may not be a team's best scorer. A 2:00 power play can yield multiple scoring chances. You probably wouldn't turn down a guaranteed scoring chance for some potential ones, but a power play also has other effects. It wears out some key players on the penalized team, and possibly gives you a chance to rest some of your own players. Additionally, it's 2 minutes off the clock during which it's very difficult for the penalized team to score. The scoring opportunities can also be higher quality, with teamwork.</p>

<p>I think the league doesn't want the choice because they think the penalty shots are exciting for the fans. But penalty shots are called so rarely anyway; and fans will get the vast majority of their 1-on-1 fix when watching shootouts after scoreless overtimes in the regular season. Plus, I think the drama of the choice adds some excitement, and power plays themselves aren't exactly boring.</p>

<p>The NFL has this idea built-in, that coaches should be able to decline most penalties. The NHL should have it too.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wjsullivan/~4/3ztsAc5OCag" width="1" />

	<section>
		Oracle <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/09/us-oracle-google-ruling-idUSBREA480KQ20140509">won their appeal</a> regarding whether APIs are copyrightable. There'll be ongoing argument about whether Google's use of those APIs is fair use or not, and perhaps an appeal to the Supreme Court, but that's the new status quo. This will doubtless result in arguments over whether Oracle's implementation of Linux APIs in Solaris 10 was a violation of copyright or not (and presumably Google are currently checking whether they own any code that Oracle reimplemented), but that's not what I'm going to talk about today.<br /><br />Oracle own some code called DTrace (Wikipedia has a good overview <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace">here</a> - what it actually does isn't especially relevant) that was originally written as part of Solaris. When Solaris was released under the CDDL, so was DTrace. The CDDL is a file-level copyleft license with some restrictions not present in the GPL - as a result, combining GPLed code with CDDLed code will (in the absence of additional permission grants) result in a work that is under an inconsistent license and cannot legally be distributed.<br /><br />Oracle wanted to make DTrace available for Linux as part of their Unbreakable Linux product. Integrating it directly into the kernel would obviously cause legal issues, so instead they implemented it as a kernel module. The copyright status of kernel modules is somewhat unclear. The GPL covers derivative works, but the definition of derivative works is a function of copyright law and judges. Making use of explicitly exported API may not be sufficient to constitute a derivative work - on the other hand, it might. This is largely untested in court. Oracle appear to believe that they're legitimate, and so have added just enough in-kernel code (and GPLed) to support DTrace, while keeping the CDDLed core of DTrace separate.<br /><br />The kernel actually has two levels of exposed (non-userspace) API - those exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL() and those exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(). Symbols exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() may only be used by modules that claim to be GPLed, with the kernel refusing to load them otherwise. There is no technical limitation on the use of symbols exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL().<br /><br />(Aside: this should not be interpreted as meaning that modules that only use symbols exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL() will not be considered derivative works. Anything exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() is considered by the author to be so fundamental to the kernel that using it would be impossible without creating a derivative work. Using something exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL() <em>may</em> result in the creation of a derivative work. Consult lawyers before attempting to release a non-GPLed Linux kernel module)<br /><br />DTrace integrates very tightly with the host kernel, and one of the things it needs access to is a high-resolution timer that is guaranteed to monotonically increase. Linux provides one in the form of ktime_get(). Unfortunately for Oracle, ktime_get() is only exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(). Attempting to call it directly from the DTrace module would fail.<br /><br />Oracle work around this in their (GPLed) kernel abstraction code. A function called <a href="https://oss.oracle.com/git/?p=linux-uek3-3.8.git;a=blob;f=kernel/dtrace/dtrace_os.c;h=f755b77181a472f3f6ddb12c31f176247a64105a;hb=HEAD#l261">dtrace_gethrtimer()</a> simply returns the value of ktime_get(). dtrace_gethrtimer() is exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL() and therefore can be called from the DTrace module.<br /><br />So, in the face of a technical mechanism designed to enforce the author's beliefs about the copyright status of callers of this function, Oracle deliberately circumvent that technical mechanism by simply re-exporting the same function under a new name. It should be emphasised that calling an EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() function does <em>not</em> inherently cause the caller to become a derivative work of the kernel - it only represents the original author's opinion of whether it would. You'd still need a court case to find out for sure. But if it turns out that the use of ktime_get() <em>does</em> cause a work to become derivative, Oracle would find it fairly difficult to argue that their infringement was accidental.<br /><br />Of course, as copyright holders of DTrace, Oracle could solve the problem by dual-licensing DTrace under the GPL as well as the CDDL. The fact that they haven't implies that they think there's enough value in keeping it under an incompatible license to risk losing a copyright infringement suit. This might be just the kind of recklessness that Oracle accused Google of <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/05/15/46513.htm">back in their last case</a>.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=31357" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

		<p>I'm working on a project to cook every recipe and major variation in

<p>Since the <a href="http://journal.wjsullivan.net/297029.html">last post about this</a>, I made:</p>

<ul> <li>Mexican Millet: Similar to &quot;Spanish Rice&quot; but with millet. Despite the name, I liked it and would make it again. I will probably have to make it again, since I still have a lot of millet left, and I don't remember the last time I made anything else with millet.</li>

<li>Black Beans in Chipotle Adobo Sauce: This is a very simple recipe and I enjoyed the flavors, but I don't understand the sauce. There is no liquid in it other than the adobo sauce from the peppers. As a result, it seemed too thick to me. I added probably 1/4 cup of hot water, and also a little lime juice to brighten it up.</li> </ul>

<p>I was only home 10 full days in April, so not much cooking happened. Hopefully there will be more in May!</p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wjsullivan/~4/rlJZe64TlS8" width="1" />

	<section>
		<p>Four weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to start eating vegan more regularly. I decided to start eating exclusively vegan during the week, and let myself eat whatever I want on the weekend. The experiment has been going well so far, and I want to take the time to reflect on the past few weeks and walk through my motivations for this mostly-vegan diet.</p>
<p><strong>Why vegan?</strong></p>
<p>I had been thinking of going vegan for a while, but there were a few things that finally made me start doing it. I had the realization that going vegan is pretty much the best way to eat healthy, humane, and environmentally friendly all at once. I read <a href="http://zenhabits.net/vegan/">this</a> article on Zen Habits and found it to be incredibly compelling. Leo appeals mostly to our need to be compassionate and help reduce animal suffering. Around the same time, I also attended <a href="http://www3.law.harvard.edu/orgs/foodlaw/themeatweeatforum/">The Meat We Eat: Forum on Industrial Animal Farming</a>, a conference put on by <a href="http://www3.law.harvard.edu/orgs/foodlaw/">Harvard&rsquo;s Food Law Society</a>. <a href="http://www.ourhenhouse.org/2014/04/four-takeaways-from-the-meat-we-eat-2014-forum-on-industrial-animal-farming/">This</a> is a nice article summarizing some of the more salient points. At the conference, I learned more about the environmental impacts of the meat industry. One particularly powerful moment for me was learning that while grass-fed beef may be more humane than grain-fed beef, grass-fed cattle actually produce more methane than grain-fed cattle. Many believe that grass-fed cattle are actually worse for the environment (per cow), although this point is a bit <a href="http://www.opb.org/news/blog/ecotrope/which-is-greener-grass-fed-or-grain-fed-beef/">controversial</a>. My takeaway from this was that while eating local, more humanely produced goods might make me feel good, it might come at a cost of a worsening impact on the environment. Locally sourced products aren&rsquo;t necessarily guaranteed to be better for the environment.</p>
<p>After I had already started being vegan during the week, Slate also ran <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/feed_the_world/2014/05/meat_eating_and_climate_change_vegetarians_impact_on_the_economy_antibiotics.html">this</a> article on what would happen if everyone in the world went vegetarian or vegan. While the scenario of everyone all going vegan at once is pretty unrealistic, it does do a good job at exploring the impact of eating animal products on the world.</p>
<p><strong>Why vegan during the week?</strong></p>
<p>Once I decided I wanted to start eating vegan, I had to think about how I could effectively make the transition. I&rsquo;m really busy with school right now, and I knew that changing my diet from no dietary restrictions to veganism would be difficult, especially since I haven&rsquo;t had much time to cook. I also knew going vegan would be hard because I&rsquo;d miss eating certain foods, and it is much harder to eat with other people as a vegan. </p>
<p>I decided that I wouldn&rsquo;t go vegan full time, but would start easing myself into it. I&rsquo;d read about both <a href="http://www.meatlessmonday.com/">Meatless Mondays</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385344740/?tag=slatmaga-20">Vegan Before 6</a> as strategies for eating more consciously without going full vegan, but I chose to be vegan during the week instead. While I haven&rsquo;t had much time to cook lately, I&rsquo;ve also been eating most of my meals during the week by myself, so I realized that even if I&rsquo;m buying my meals, I have enough control over where I&rsquo;m eating that I could be vegan without too much hassle. Then when I spend time with other people on the weekend, I can eat what I want (often still choosing to eat vegan when I can). </p>
<p><strong>How has it gone?</strong></p>
<p>I found that being vegan during the week actually wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I thought it might be. I woke up one Monday morning and just decided to do it and see how long I could go for. After four weeks, I&rsquo;d say it is going well enough that I&rsquo;ll just stick with it.</p>
<p>One of the most challenging parts of being vegan has been finding vegetarian food without cheese in it. We Americans really love our cheese. I&rsquo;ve found that I haven&rsquo;t really craved meat much, but that I have craved both cheese and chocolate. Fortunately, many dark chocolates are vegan, but I haven&rsquo;t tried any cheese substitutes, so I&rsquo;ve mostly been allowing myself to indulge in cheese a bit on the weekends. I&rsquo;ve also been eating eggs on the weekend for protein. I have to be much more mindful about making sure I eat enough protein during the week, because otherwise I can get pretty hungry and wind up snacking on a lot of carbs. As long as I keep myself full, I&rsquo;ve found that I can manage any non-vegan food cravings pretty effectively. While I haven&rsquo;t been eating a super diverse set of foods, I actually enjoy what I have been eating, and look forward to meals still.</p>
<p>I wound up catching a cold during this experiment, so it is a little hard to comment on the impact of my veganism on my health and energy. I would say that eating vegan is having a great impact on my GI tract (probably all the fiber), and my skin has been pretty clear. I would say that my energy is definitely not any worse than before, and maybe even a bit better, although it is hard to tell. </p>
<p>My plan is to stick with my weekday veganism for now, and maybe start reducing my weekend indulgences as I get more used to it. </p>

	<section>
		<p>I have been enrolled in <a href="https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/WGS/sp14/WGS.700/index.html">WGS.700</a>, a course on queer theory and politics. As a queer person, I took the course because I was interested in learning more about the fundamental works that structure queer activism today, and to become equipped with theoretical knowledge of what shapes the way I interact with the world.</p>
<p>We read a ton this semester (including ~8 full books, and chapters from many others). Here are some of the texts that really resonated with me and I think are worth reading if you are interested in queer theory and/or politics. In rough order based on our syllabus:</p>
<ul><li><strong><a href="http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/scriptorium/wlm/womid/">The Woman-Identified Woman</a> by Radicalesbians </strong>- I think this piece captures the energy within radical lesbian feminism quite well and set the tone for the rest of our semester.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://ws301spring2008.wikispaces.com/file/view/Compulsory+Heterosexuality.pdf">Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence</a> by Adrienne Rich </strong>- this was one of the first and classic pieces we read that challenges heterosexuality as normal, and casts lesbianism as an extension of feminism</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Public-Sex-The-Culture-Radical/dp/1573440965">Public Sex: The Culture of Radical Sex</a> by Pat Califia </strong>- we read excerpts of this book. Califia&rsquo;s arguments in favor of lesbianism, and lesbian sadomasochism present an interesting and compelling critique to anti-porn, anti-sex feminism.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.feminish.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Rubin1984.pdf">Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality</a> by Gayle Rubin </strong>- Gayle Rubin introduces the idea of the &ldquo;charmed circle,&rdquo; within which one&rsquo;s sexual practices are considered &ldquo;good&rdquo; and outside which one&rsquo;s sexual practices are considered &ldquo;bad.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.qrd.org/qrd/misc/text/queers.read.this">Queers Read This</a> - </strong>This leaflet contains some of the most raw writings about being queer in society, aimed at rousing fellow queers to action.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.unitedinanger.com/">United in Anger</a> </strong>- this actually a film. A great film about ACT UP, an AIDS advocacy group.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-History-Sexuality-Vol-Introduction/dp/0679724699">The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1</a> by Michel Foucault </strong>- yes, I did invoke the F word. I did not necessarily appreciate it when I first read this, but this work is actually very important to future queer theoretical critique and analysis. Foucault introduces the idea that sexuality is constructed through discourse, and that power over the queer subject is more complex than the power of the state over a subject.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Queer-Studies-Critical-Anthology/dp/0822336189">Black Queer Studies, A Critical Anthology</a> - </strong>we read a number of essays from this anthology. A number of the essays examine the intersection of race and sexuality, particularly to critique early queer theoretical works.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Imagining-Transgender-An-Ethnography-Category/dp/0822338696">Imagining Transgender: An Ethnography of a Category</a> by David Valentine </strong>- this is one of the best and most accessible books we read. David Valentine explores the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; and how it has been used as an identity category and for political activism.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Imagining-Transgender-An-Ethnography-Category/dp/0822338696">Techniques of Pleasure: BDSM and the Circuits of Sexuality</a> by Margot Weiss </strong> - One of the chapters in this book examines the potential of BDSM as a transgressive act through interviews with heterosexual male dominants (HMDs). Weiss argues that many HMDs employ a neoliberal narrative of choice to justify their actions, but that ultimately it is impossible to free ourselves of the social structures of race and class through choice and acts.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.organizingupgrade.com/index.php/modules-menu/beyond-capitalism/item/1002-marriage-will-never-set-us-free">Marriage Will Never Set Us Free</a> by Dean Spade and Craig Willse - </strong>Dean Spade and Craig Willse present a radical queer criticism of gay marriage. This article does a great job at theorizing what queer activism should look like, and how the &ldquo;gay and lesbian&rdquo; narrative of equality and fight for gay marriage is actually very oppressive to queer people.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Terrorist-Assemblages-Homonationalism-Directions-Studies/dp/082234114X">Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times</a> by Jasbir Puar</strong> - Jasbir Puar presents a ruthless criticism of &ldquo;sexual exceptionalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;homonationalism&rdquo; in the United States and abroad. She argues that tolerance of certain queers at home leads to greater oppression of racial &ldquo;others&rdquo; abroad. This text is very challenging, but very interesting. Puar also gave a great <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a0Dkn3SnWM">talk</a> on this subject that is worth watching.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Against-Equality-Prisons-Will-Protect/dp/0615678920">Their Laws Will Never Make Us Safer</a> in </strong><strong><em>Against Equality: Prisons Will Not Protect You </em></strong><strong>by Dean Spade - </strong>this is a great critique of the prison system. It argues in favor of prison abolition and against the idea that criminalization of hate crimes will reduce violence against queer people.</li>
</ul><p>There are a number of other texts that we read that I have not included here for brevity, but would be happy to discuss further if this is of interest.</p>

		I picked up a Panasonic BDT-230 a couple of months ago. Then I discovered that even though it appeared fairly straightforward to make it DVD region free (I have a large pile of PAL region 2 DVDs), the US models refuse to play back PAL content. We live in an era of software-defined functionality. While Panasonic <em>could</em> have designed a separate hardware SKU with a hard block on PAL output, that would seem like unnecessary expense. So, playing with the firmware seemed like a reasonable start.<br /><br />Panasonic provide a nice <a href="http://panasonic.jp/support/global/cs/bd/">download site</a> for firmware updates, so I grabbed the most recent and set to work. <a href="http://www.binwalk.org">Binwalk</a> found a squashfs filesystem, which was a good sign. Less good was the block at the end of the firmware with "RSA" written around it in large letters. The simple approach of hacking the firmware, building a new image and flashing it to the device didn't appear likely to work.<br /><br />Which left dealing with the installed software. The BDT-230 is based on a Mediatek chipset, and like most (all?) Mediatek systems runs a large binary called "bdpprog" that spawns about eleventy billion threads and does pretty much everything. Runnings strings over that showed, well, rather a lot, but most promisingly included a reference to "/mnt/sda1/vudu/vudu.sh". Other references to /mnt/sda1 made it pretty clear that it was the mount point for USB mass storage. There were a couple of other constraints that had to be satisfied, but soon attempting to run Vudu was actually setting a blank root password and launching telnetd.<br /><br />/acfg/config_file_global.txt was the next stop. This is a set of tokens and values with useful looking names like "IDX_GB_PTT_COUNTRYCODE". I tried changing the values, but unfortunately made a poor guess - on next reboot, the player had reset itself to DVD region 5, Blu Ray region C and was talking to me in Russian. More inconveniently, the Vudu icon had vanished and I couldn't launch a shell any more.<br /><br />But where there's one obvious mechanism for running arbitrary code, there's probably another. /usr/local/bin/browser.sh contained the wonderful line:<pre>
export LD_PRELOAD=/mnt/sda1/bbb/libSegFault.so
</pre>, so then it was just a matter of building a library that hooked open() and launched inetd and dropping that into the right place, and then opening the browser.<br /><br />This time I set the country code correctly, rebooted and now I can actually watch Monkey Dust again. Hurrah! But, at the same time, concerning. This software has been written without any concern for security, and it listens on the network by default. If it took me this little time to find two entirely independent ways to run arbitrary code on the device, it doesn't seem like a stretch to believe that there are probably other vulnerabilities that can be exploited with less need for physical access.<br /><br />The depressing part of this is that there's no reason to believe that Panasonic are especially bad here - especially since a large number of vendors are shipping much the same Mediatek code, and so probably have similar (if not identical) issues. The future is made up of network-connected appliances that are using your electricity to mine somebody else's Dogecoin. Our nightmarish dystopia may be stranger than expected.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=31178" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

LifeSlice is a neat OS X application that takes a snapshot with your webcam and a screenshot at pre-defined intervals throughout the day. It also keeps track of other goodies such as how many keys you have pressed, how many mouse clicks you’ve made, etc. You can generate daily and/or monthly reports with your slices and stats.</p>
<p>It’s been pretty funny to spy on myself so far. I’ve uploaded a few example webcam shots. Right now I have the slices configured to run every half hour, and sometimes I realize a slice is about to be taken (and might change my behavior!) and other times I don’t. A few times I haven’t been at my computer at all. When I’m really concentrating, I look borderline angry, which I find really hilarious and also explains why people sometimes think I’m mad when I’m working.</p>
<p>I’ve been incredibly mobile in my laptop usage - I’ve used my computer in 8 different locations since I installed LifeSlice Wednesday night! I haven’t really looked at any of the other stats yet, but will go back and check these out once I’m in serious paper writing mode.</p>
<p>I am also wearing a sweater or hoodie that is red or blue in almost every slice. It can get warmer any time now, please.</p>

	<section>
		<a href="http://www.mitre.org">MITRE</a> gave a presentation on UEFI Secure Boot at SyScan earlier this month. You should read the <a href="http://www.syscan.org/index.php/download/get/6e597f6067493dd581eed737146f3afb/SyScan2014_CoreyKallenberg_SetupforFailureDefeatingSecureBoot.zip">the presentation and paper</a>, because it's really very good.<br /><br />It describes a couple of attacks. The first is that some platforms store their Secure Boot policy in a run time UEFI variable. UEFI variables are split into two broad categories - boot time and run time. Boot time variables can only be accessed while in boot services - the moment the bootloader or kernel calls ExitBootServices(), they're inaccessible. Some vendors chose to leave the variable containing firmware settings available during run time, presumably because it makes it easier to implement tools for modifying firmware settings at the OS level. Unfortunately, some vendors left bits of Secure Boot policy in this space. The naive approach would be to simply disable Secure Boot entirely, but that means that the OS would be able to detect that the system wasn't in a secure state[1]. A more subtle approach is to modify the policy, such that the firmware chooses not to verify the signatures on files stored on fixed media. Drop in a new bootloader and victory is ensured.<br /><br />But that's not a beautiful approach. It depends on the firmware vendor having made that mistake. What if you could just rewrite arbitrary variables, even if they're only supposed to be accessible in boot services? Variables are all stored in flash, connected to the chipset's SPI controller. Allowing arbitrary access to that from the OS would make it straightforward to modify the variables, even if they're boot time-only. So, thankfully, the SPI controller has some control mechanisms. The first is that any attempt to enable the write-access bit will cause a System Management Interrupt, at which point the CPU should trap into System Management Mode and (if the write attempt isn't authorised) flip it back. The second is to disable access from the OS entirely - all writes have to take place in System Management Mode.<br /><br />The MITRE results show that around 0.03% of modern machines enable the second option. That's unfortunate, but the first option should still be sufficient[2]. Except the first option requires on the SMI actually firing. And, conveniently, Intel's chipsets have a bit that allows you to disable all SMI sources[3], and then have another bit to disable further writes to the first bit. Except 40% of the machines MITRE tested didn't bother setting that lock bit. So you can just disable SMI generation, remove the write-protect bit on the SPI controller and then write to arbitrary variables, including the SecureBoot enable one.<br /><br />This is, uh, obviously a problem. The good news is that this has been communicated to firmware and system vendors and it should be fixed in the future. The bad news is that a significant proportion of existing systems can probably have their Secure Boot implementation circumvented. This is pretty unsurprisingly - I suggested that the first few generations would be broken <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/12897.html">back in 2012</a>. Security tends to be an iterative process, and changing a branch of the industry that's historically not had to care into one that forms the root of platform trust is a difficult process. As the MITRE paper says, UEFI Secure Boot will be a genuine improvement in security. It's just going to take us a little while to get to the point where the more obvious flaws have been worked out.<br /><br />[1] Unless the malware was intelligent enough to hook GetVariable, detect a request for SecureBoot and then give a fake answer, but who would do that?<br />[2] Impressively, basically everyone enables that.<br />[3] Great for dealing with bugs caused by YOUR ENTIRE COMPUTER BEING INTERRUPTED BY ARBITRARY VENDOR CODE, except unfortunately it also probably disables chunks of thermal management and stops various other things from working as well.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=30773" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

	<section>
		<p>I have been enrolled in the <a href="https://hst.mit.edu/academics/gems">Graduate Education in Medical Sciences </a>program for the past year. This Spring, I am doing a <a href="https://hst.mit.edu/academics/course/hst-240-translational-medicine-preceptorship">Translational Medicine Preceptorship</a> with <a href="http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/61067">Dr. Maulik Majmudar</a>. I just finished my first week, and it has already been an amazing experience. I spent two days this week watching <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/nuclear-stress-test/basics/definition/prc-20012978">Nuclear Imaging Stress Tests</a> and then two more days in the <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cath/">Cardiac Catheterization Lab</a>, both at MGH. I&rsquo;ve learned a ton already, and wanted to write up a few interesting things I learned about stress testing.</p>
<p>Stress testing is conducted for three main reasons: <strong>screening, diagnosis, </strong>and<strong> prognosis</strong>. High risk individuals receive stress testing for screening, those with chest pain receive stress testing for diagnosis, and those with known/existing heart conditions receive stress testing for prognosis. Stress testing can be either <strong>physiological</strong> or <strong>pharmacologic</strong>. A physical stress test usually involves walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bicycle. <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1827166-overview">Pharmacologic stress tests</a> require an injection of a vasodilator to increase the load on the heart. </p>
<p>Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) recordings and blood pressure measurements are made and monitored throughout the course of the rest and stress intervals. There can be a number of different &ldquo;readouts&rdquo; that are done to quantify the impact of stress on the heart. The common ones used at MGH include the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003869.htm">echocardiogram</a>, which is ultrasound based, and <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/nuclear-stress-test/basics/definition/prc-20012978">nuclear imaging</a>, which is involves the injection of radioactive isotopes. Other imaging modalities, such as CT, PET, and MRI, are also used. </p>
<p>The personnel running the stress tests look for significant changed in the ECG and BP during the stress test, as well as significant changes in blood flow to the heart, along with the heart&rsquo;s ability to contract properly, to determine how well the heart performs under stress. If the results of the stress test indicate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia">ischemia</a> (heart muscle death), the patient may be referred to the cardiac catheterization lab, where physicians can take a closer look at the arteries of the heart for blockages that may have caused the tissue death.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for my next post, when I&rsquo;ll write about cardiac catheterization.</p>

Within an hour of landing in Barcelona, I was pickpocketed by a pretty well-dressed gentleman who was so skilled at his profession that, on the shuttle from Terminal 2 to the train, he unzipped the wallet hanging across my chest at my side and extracted my ATM card and the 100 Euro I'd just taken out of the ATM machine. I felt nothing physically, but I did have a little spidey sense thing happen so I looked over at him -- he just stared right back at me. I didn't notice the wallet unzipped until after getting off the bus. It was not a crowded bus; there was a lot of space between people and I'm surprised no one else saw this happen either. Or maybe they did and didn't say anything. Or maybe he had some associates standing around him.
</p>

<p>
I guess by interrupting him I got to keep the rest of my credit cards, passport, and US dollars. Could've been a lot worse.
</p>

<p>
I was aware of the pickpocketing risks here, but I hadn't even arrived in the city yet. Be careful out there!

	<section>
		<p>Jon Barilone from the Connected Learning Alliance sent me a few interview questions for a podcast. In order to collect my thoughts, I decided to prepare some notes. The notes got longer, and eventually seemed like something I should just post here. It’s pretty rough, and I apologize for any typos or errors you might find. </p>

<p><strong>1. Could you explain a little more about how “peer-to-peer learning” and “open learning” benefits young learners?</strong></p>

<p>Your peers are important not just for young people, although the importance of your peer group might more important at certain stages in your life. Maybe you just give less of a damn when you are older? </p>

<p>In terms of learning, peer-learning is both a good way to learn because it gives you access to a group of people who can help out when you get stuck, and likewise, when they get stuck and you help them - your own learning deepens (because you have to empathize and look at something from a different perspective that you may not have considered beforehand). We all probably have had experience where we had to teach someone else and as a result felt like we had actually discovered something new about the topic. </p>

<p>And then, there is a whole range of important skills that you just pick up as side-effects as part of peer-to-peer learning - those are the skills and habits that make you a better learner yourself - and there is growing awareness that these skills might be very important. It’s thing like communicating (speaking AND listening), collaborating with others, empathizing etc…</p>

<p>And open learning is really a misnomer. What we mean by open learning these days should really be what we call learning, but we have to call it open because so much of our learning is restricted to certain spaces and times. Open learning means that if there is a community of practice and we are learning some practices that are relevant in that community, that we can now engage with them. It’s really learning by apprenticeship, but using electronic tools to do it at scale. So instead of learning about science, you learn to be a scientist. That sense of agency and participation is at the core of “open” for me … </p>

<p><strong>2. The need to give education an update, to bring it out of the 20th century and into the 21st, is getting a lot of attention these days. What has the formal education world collectively been doing right to enable this “update,” and where do you think they could they improve?</strong></p>

<p>This question reminds me of the many calls to disrupt education. I am skeptical of those claims. Partly because so often they are made by those who did very well, and benefited, from the institutions they are now aiming to disrupt. But also, because I’ve always preferred a different approach, an approach that is better described by the term hacking - because hacking is playful and it tinkers with ideas and systems in order to improve them. It doesn’t need to dismantle them. It just hates it when a system isn’t working as well as it could … so hacking education is about making education better - and that means not always following the rules. I like that. </p>

<p>What has education done right - it has created an incredibly important social institution and has given access to a huge number of people. We need to remember that we’ve come a long way since the time when only a handful of people had access to schools and university. </p>

<p>And a lot of learning happens in schools and university, even when some of the best learning happens in study-groups and outside of the lectures and formal “teaching” moments. </p>

<p>But what the education system is struggling with is - and this is very common for any large institution or system - inertia. Clearly the computer and now the Internet are really fundamental technological shifts that affect how we think about, and how we support, learning. I would like to see schools and universities more involved in
* experimenting with that at a more fundamental level - not just moving the current models online (lectures are now on video), and maybe as one strategy within that
* use technology to open up, let more people actually participate in research projects you are organizing, or let your students participate in online communities as part of their studies … </p>

<p>I would like to see more leadership in this space coming from those who care most about learning and based on my personal experience, those are the people who are currently working in the education system. So, I would like the institutions to be more involved in driving positive change … at the moment they seem so nervous about change, that they rather hold on to how things “have always been done” as long as they can. </p>

<p><strong>3. One way Connected Learning is being introduced to people is to say it “builds on the education basics (those 3 ‘R’s of Reading, Riting, Rithmetic) by introducing a 4th ‘R’: Relevance.” Making learning in the classroom relevant to life outside it. Why do you feel this need for “Relevance” is so important for young learners?</strong></p>

<p>I think relevance is key for everyone and any kind of learning. Why would you learn something that doesn’t connect to you in any meaningful way? If you have no interest in the topic whatsoever, the only reason to learn that remains is to please your teacher or parents. That’s not a great motivator - and as I know from my own experience - you tend to develop strategies that let you do well in the system, but don’t actually lead to much learning. </p>

<p>And I don’t actually like that framing. I don’t think the 3Rs are the core basics. I think it’s the skills and practices of being a better learner that are the real basics. </p>

<p><strong>4. Even though more young people have access to post-secondary education than ever before, it seems we’re still a long way from college being ‘the great equalizer.’ How do you think our education system, and the way we think about learning in general, must evolve in order to deal with this equity issue?</strong></p>

<p>Equity is a very big issue. I don’t think it can be solved by one institution without taking into account other broader factors of socio-economic equity. Kids of low-income families are not going to have the same opportunities as kids from middle-class families. And when a CEO can make a few thousand times the salary of the lowest paid salary of someone in the company - then something is just broken about how we value human beings. </p>

<p>But at the same time the system should do a lot more to try and provide good opportunities to everyone. And I think this is a political failure, rather than a school or university failure. I think it’s something that a society has to decide how it wants to deal with. I grew up in a country where good public education is the norm. This idea that you would privatize something as important as education is foreign to me - and I don’t understand why voters in the US don’t demand better education. It really makes me sad to see a great public university system like California straining from budget cuts … and then seeing the outrageous salaries that football coaches make. It doesn’t make any sense to me. </p>

<p>So, with P2PU I am trying to provide more equity and access, using technology and the generosity of people who want to share their learning and help others - but I am not doing it to dismantle the existing institutions. </p>

<p><strong>5. Paint us a quick picture of the future for you and Peer2Peer University. It’s 10 years from now and you’ve accomplished everything you’ve wanted to with P2PU – how has the world changed because of it?</strong></p>

<p>Success would mean that we’ve figured out how to use the Internet to involve more people in better learning opportunities. </p>

<p>For me, other people are the most important piece in learning - and the Internet let’s us connect in ways that were simply unimaginable even 20 years ago. So, if we can help figure out what that means - that would be great. </p>

<p>In one scenario success would mean that the ideas we (and many others) care about become so “normal” that we aren’t needed anymore. It’s the norm that people design their own course of learning, that they work on problems they care about together with their peers, that they make use of social technologies to connect and collaborate with people from all over the world - and that they develop deep and meaningful and lasting relationships with other people that go well beyond learning. Some of that is happening - for example, peer-learning and support is part of the connected learning framework … but it’s probably a long long way. </p>

<p>The other scenario is probably a little more pragmatic, and that is P2PU provides a space and a community for the people who are hacking education - where they can come together, support each other, share notes, and collaborate to improve the existing institutions, and also create alternatives and new models for learning online. Where those innovators don’t feel like they are isolated within their institutions. </p>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/156924264X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=156924264X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wjsullivannet-20">Veganomicon</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wjsullivannet-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=156924264X" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />.

</p>

<p>Since the <a href="http://journal.wjsullivan.net/296418.html">last post about this</a> I made:</p>

<ul>

<li>Gazborscht: This was not a good recipe. 3 cups shredded beets? How many is that? I ended up shredding way too many beets. I'd really like to have the pre-shredded amounts by weight. Too bad I didn't record them myself either, but I'm going to guess that it's ballpark 3 medium beets. I did like the end result, though.</li>

<li>Chickpea Cutlets: Nice and quick to make, but didn't seem to cook all the way through, and frying time was lower than suggested, otherwise burning was starting to happen. Maybe this means my temp was too high? But it was definitely only medium. Considering finishing them in the oven. Might make good breakfast sausages.</li>

<li>Vegetable Broth: I hate putting good vegetables in just to make broth, but I wanted to see how much better it was than my usual method of freezing vegetable trimmings throughout the week. Unfortunately, this stock was way better than my leftovers method. If I can get some composting system going, I'll feel a lot less bad about boiling vegetables for stock and then tossing their carcasses.</li>

</ul>

<p>For non-Veganomicon cooking:</p>

<ul>

<li>Carrot risotto: with carrot stock that I made earlier in the week. This was delicious. The Dirt Candy chef Amanda Cohen was on <a href="http://www.ming.com/simply-ming/episodes/season-11/episode-1108-amanda-cohen-and-seasoning-vegetables.htm">Simply Ming</a> recently. It wasn't my favorite episode of the show &mdash; Ming does a not-so-impressive cauliflower steak in the opening segment, which is already not my favorite feed-the-vegetarian dish, and he repeats a few too many times that vegetables can be just as good as meat. But she makes a beautiful carrot pasta. And the risotto directions seemed just about perfect. I did not yet make the add-ons (carrot dumplings and fried carrot strips) but I will next time.</li>

<ul>

<li>Raisin spice scones from <em>Vegan Brunch</em> &mdash; These taste kind of unpleasant for some reason. Maybe I didn't bake them long enough; they seem a little doughy on the inside, but they also already seem a little dry. It's possible I overworked the dough.</li>

</ul>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1551520672/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1551520672&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wjsullivannet-20"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1551520672&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=wjsullivannet-20" style="padding: 0.5em;" /></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wjsullivannet-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1551520672" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />

<ul>
<li>Zucchini Bread from <em>How It All Vegan</em>. Tastes good; texture was not great, but I blame myself because I was a little shy on baking powder. And very shy on non-expired baking powder. One odd thing in this book's recipes is that they like to call for &quot;sweetener&quot; without specifying. In this case, I used sugar, and I bet I was supposed to use something liquid like agave, because I had to add a 1/2 cup water to make it at all moist.</li>

</ul>


<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738213756/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0738213756&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wjsullivannet-20"><img border="0" src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0738213756&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=wjsullivannet-20" style="padding: 0.5em;" /></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wjsullivannet-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0738213756" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />

<ul>

<li>Roasted Winter Vegetable Jambalaya from <em>The Inspired Vegan</em>. I was very skeptical of the idea of taking lovely roasted vegetables and simmering them in liquid, but I really liked the result. I substituted turnips for parsnips because I thought I didn't have any parsnips, except then I did. But that's okay, because I'm desperate for ways I'm not sick of to use all the turnips I have.</li>

	<section>
		<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/post/80528744210/boston-qs-update">this</a> post, I have been working on putting together a Code of Conduct for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/">Boston QS</a>&rsquo;s meetups. We announced our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/pages/Code_of_Conduct/">Code Of Conduct</a> Thursday just in time for one of our events. I&rsquo;ve included the full text of the announcement below. </p>
<p>There were a few resources that I found particularly helpful while writing this up. The first was a <a href="http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq">Code of Conduct 101 + FAQ</a> about why we need code of conducts. It both motivates the need for codes of conducts in our community and gives you the information needed to address questions your community members may have.The second was a post on <a href="http://adainitiative.org/2014/02/howto-design-a-code-of-conduct-for-your-community/">how to design a Code of Conduct for your community</a>. This is a great resource on what to consider when designing and implementing a Code of Conduct. I also found reviewing specific Codes of Conducts from other communities and conferences to be particularly helpful. These included the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/">Django Code of Conduct</a>, the <a href="http://citizencodeofconduct.org/">Citizen Code of Conduct</a>, the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/conference/San-Francisco-2013/antiharassment.php">QS13 Anti-Harassment Policy</a>, the <a href="http://community.bocoup.com/conduct/">Bocoup Code of Conduct</a>, and <a href="http://theorizingtheweb.tumblr.com/post/79357700249/anti-harassment-statement">Theorizing The Web&rsquo;s Anti-Harassment Statement</a>. </p>

<div></div>
<div>We here with Boston Quantified Self are dedicated to hosting meetups and events that are safe and comfortable for everyone involved, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, physical appearance, and beliefs. As our group expands, we&rsquo;d like to take the opportunity to set forth clear rules and guidelines for all our events moving forward. We have put together a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/pages/Code_of_Conduct/" target="_blank">code of conduct</a> that will come into effect for all future events (including the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BostonQS/events/170093192/" target="_blank">QS Co-Lab</a>, which is tonight! Hope to see you there!). </div>
<div></div>
<div>Please review the code of conduct before you attend your next event with us. I&rsquo;ve also pasted the code of conduct text at the end of this email. If you believe someone is violating our code of conduct, please report it by either speaking with or emailing the organizer for your particular event directly. For more information about code of conducts (and why we chose to implement one), check out this <a href="http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq" target="_blank">Code of Conduct 101 + FAQ</a>.

		Home stretch!<br /><br />I managed to check a few things off on the front end. &nbsp;Most importantly, the icons, styling, and markup are all done. &nbsp;Location services seems to be working.<br /><br />One worry I have is that my app is absurdly simple in functionality. &nbsp;I've read that Apple will reject apps that are too simple, which doesn't bode well for my short timetable. &nbsp;I might have to look at shoehorning in a settings menu, interactive maps, or some other nonsense.<br /><br />My experience with Cordova thus far has been positive, although there are a ton of obvious pain points. &nbsp;For example, deploying an icon for your app-- It's probably one of the first things you do during the development process-- took me about an hour and a half because of all the sizing issues.<br /><br />It would be easy to un-suck Cordova with some simple hooks and scripts. &nbsp;The authors got pretty close, but it's nowhere near as smooth as, say, an Express install (although it does share much of the same technology).<br /><br />How about a version of Cordova that's just the Javascript API and compliation tools? &nbsp;Anyone?

	<section>
		<p>Happy <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/its-404-day">4/04 Day</a>! </p>
<p>Recently, I was at the Cambridge Public Library looking for divorce paperwork for Massachusetts (for more on why that happened, check out <a href="http://www.kendraalbert.com/post/81240570057/filing-for-divorce-in-ma-doing-law-school-right">this post</a>.) CPL doesn’t use filtering software on their computers (woo!) and has a clear and concise <a href="http://www.cambridgema.gov/cpl/Services/Computers.aspx">use policy</a> as well as individual privacy screens. From that perspective, it was an ideal library computer experience.</p>
<p>However the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/forms/probate-and-family/cjd301shortform.pdf">short form financial statement</a> (non-malware pdf at link), available from the MA court website and necessary for many court filings, was actually blocked by CPL’s anti-malware software. I tried a couple of different times to download it, including on different browsers, before eventually finding the form was available elsewhere on the Plymouth County Court website. </p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>When I finished my session, I went up to the super nice librarian who had helped me figure out the computer system and mentioned that a site was blocked. She commented that I must be wrong – that CPL didn’t block anything. I clarified that it was the malware protection software, she had me write down what was blocked on a post-it note, and I went on my way.</p>
<p>I accessed the PDF from my computer later that day, and was pretty certain there was nothing harmful there. Additionally, this document is super important for people who are filing for divorce or child custody who make under $75,000 – many of the people that the Cambridge public library serves. I don’t imagine I’m the only one who has encountered this problem. Anti-malware software, just like filters, can be over-inclusive.</p>
<p>However, not using malware protection is probably not a good solution – I imagine that CPL has thought through its policy on this and come to the conclusion that significant staff time and energy is saved by protecting users from themselves on the front end. So how to solve this problem of over-inclusive anti-malware software, especially in scenarios like that form?</p>
<p>Providing people with information on how to report problems with malware protection seems like an excellent first step. Neither the pop-up nor the computer use agreement had any information about reporting problems with malware protection. There was no information to suggest that websites could be wrongly blocked by malware protection, and as such, non-tech savvy folks may just conclude that there’s nothing to be done. Often, filtering software will include the “if you think this has been wrongly blocked, do X” when it blocks a site –a similar message would go a long way towards helping folks who are trying to access legitimate information. An aside: if the website had been serving malware, it seems like the CPL would be in an excellent position to contact the MA court system to let them know about the problem, as opposed to me. Not necessarily a librarian’s job, but maybe something to consider.</p>
<p>Additionally, the casualness of the reporting procedure did not reassure me that this particular concern was taken seriously. Although the form is now unblocked (I went back to check), the response from the librarian, otherwise perfectly nice, was unhelpful. Letting librarians who might be manning a computer use desk know that patrons may report blocked sites, or even better, having a way for patrons to do so directly from the computer, would both be solutions that would better enable libraries to gather information. At-computer reporting could allow inclusion of a URL in the report, something my post-it note did not have.</p>
<p>In general, even if your library isn’t running filters, it’s worth thinking about what other roadblocks patrons may encounter, and having systems that encourage reporting and feedback. Informal methods may catch some problems, like this one, but may not provide enough information to spot patterns. For libraries that serve populations who might not have other methods to access material online, it’s vital to ensure that patrons can get to the information they might need without running afoul of overzealous protection software.</p>

		It's come to my attention that APP WEEK 2014 is more than halfway over.<br /><br />The backend is looking good-- Importing works, 2dsphere indexing works, and intersections work. &nbsp;Still have a bit more work to do matching the shapes up to actual route numbers, but that shouldn't be bad.<br /><br />I think the biggest challenge is going to be hooking up the <a href="http://www.mbta.com/rider_tools/developers/Default.asp">realtime data</a> and creating a notion of inbound/outbound. &nbsp;This is tricky in Boston, because I suspect there are places where going "Inbound" actually takes you away from the city center.<br /><br />The frontend? &nbsp;Haven't started it. &nbsp;Whoops!

	<h1>2014-04-03 23:42:26: <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/30577.html">Mozilla and leadership</a> by mjg59 via <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/">Matthew Garrett</a></h1>
	<section>
		<a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/17174.html">A post I wrote</a> back in 2012 got linked from a couple of the discussions relating to Brendan Eich being appointed Mozilla CEO. The tldr version is "If members of your community doesn't trust their leader socially, the leader's technical competence is irrelevant". That seems to have played out here.<br /><br />In terms of background[1]: in 2008, Brendan donated money to the campaign for Proposition 8, a Californian constitutional amendment that expressly defined marriage as being between one man and one woman[2]. Both before and after that he had donated money to a variety of politicians who shared many political positions, including the definition of marriage as being between one man and one woman[3].<br /><br />Mozilla is an interesting organisation. It consists of the for-profit Mozilla Corporation, which is wholly owned by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation. The Corporation's bylaws require it to work to further the Foundation's goals, and any profit is reinvested in Mozilla. Mozilla developers are employed by the Corporation rather than the Foundation, and as such the CEO is responsible for ensuring that those developers are able to achieve those goals.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a> discusses individual liberty in the context of use of the internet, not in a wider social context. Brendan's appointment was very much in line with the explicit aims of both the Foundation and the Corporation - whatever his views on marriage equality, nobody has seriously argued about his commitment to improving internet freedom. So, from that perspective, he should have been a fine choice.<br /><br />But that ignores the effect on the wider community. People don't attach themselves to communities merely because of explicitly stated goals - they do so because they feel that the community is aligned with their overall aims. The Mozilla community is one of the most diverse in free software, at least in part because Mozilla's stated goals and behaviour are fairly inspirational. People who identify themselves with other movements backing individual liberties are likely to identify with Mozilla. So, unsurprisingly, there's a large number of socially progressive individuals (LGBT or otherwise) in the Mozilla community, both inside and outside the Corporation.<br /><br />A CEO who's donated money to strip rights[4] from a set of humans will not be trusted by many who believe that all humans should have those rights. It's not just limited to individuals directly affected by his actions - if someone's shown that they're willing to strip rights from another minority for political or religious reasons, what's to stop them attempting to do the same to you? Even if you personally feel safe, do you trust someone who's willing to do that to your friends? In a community that's made up of many who are either LGBT or identify themselves as allies, that loss of trust is inevitably going to cause community discomfort.<br /><br />The first role of a leader should be to manage that. Instead, in the first few days of Brendan's leadership, we heard nothing of substance - at best, an apology for pain being caused rather than an apology for the act that caused the pain. And then there was an <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/mozilla-ceo-gay-marriage-firestorm-could-hurt-firefox-cause-q-a/">interview</a> which demonstrated remarkable tone deafness. He made no attempt to alleviate the concerns of the community. There were repeated non-sequiturs  about Indonesia.  It sounded like he had no idea at all why the community that he was now leading was unhappy.<br /><br />And, today, he resigned. It's easy to get into hypotheticals - could he have compromised his principles for the sake of Mozilla? Would an initial discussion of the distinction between the goals of members of the Mozilla community and the goals of Mozilla itself have made this more palatable? If the board had known this would happen, would they have made the same choice - and if they didn't know, why not?<br /><br />But that's not the real point. The point is that the community didn't trust Brendan, and Brendan chose to leave rather than do further harm to the community. Trustworthy leadership is important. Communities should reflect on whether their leadership reflects not only their beliefs, but the beliefs of those that they would like to join the community. Fail to do so and you'll drive them away instead.<br /><br />[1] For people who've been living under a rock<br />[2] Proposition 8 itself was a response to an ongoing court case that, at the point of Proposition 8 being proposed, appeared likely to support the overturning of Proposition 22, an earlier Californian ballot measure that legally (rather than constitutionally) defined marriage as being between one man and one woman. Proposition 22 was overturned, and for a few months before Proposition 8 passed, gay marriage was legal in California.<br />[3] <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/02/controversial-mozilla-ceo-made-donations-right-wing-candidates-brendan-eich">http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/02/controversial-mozilla-ceo-made-donations-right-wing-candidates-brendan-eich</a><br />[4] Brendan made a donation on October 25th, 2008. This postdates the overturning of Proposition 22, and as such gay marriage was legal in California at the time of this donation. Donating to Proposition 8 at that point was not about supporting the status quo, it was about changing the constitution to forbid something that courts had found was protected by the state constitution.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=30577" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

	<section>
		<p>Most law school assignments don&rsquo;t make you reflect deeply on your relationship to your community or to the legal system. But I actually did something this semester that made me heavily consider how I as a law student relate to Cambridge, and how the law relates to everyday people. I tried to figure out how to file for divorce in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>To be clear, no, I&rsquo;m not married, and no, I&rsquo;m not getting divorced.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a seminar called Access to Civil Justice, which is all about how difficult it is for people of low or moderate means to access the civil litigation system, and how we can fix it. It&rsquo;s a pretty awesome class all around, full of mind-blowing insights. For example, the entire budget of the New York state court system would only buy 7.5 hours of lawyer time for each person in New York with a justicable (&ldquo;could involve the legal system&rdquo;) problem. That&rsquo;s not very much lawyering.</p>
<p>As part of this class, we have to figure out how to file for divorce. And not as Harvard Law School students. Unlike us, most folks who are filing for divorce <em>pro se</em> (without a lawyer) don&rsquo;t have access to a personal computer and an incredible research library, or an endless amount of time to putz around online. Here was the prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your name is Angelina Johnson. You are 25 years old. You were born and raised in Cambridge, MA. At age 14, both of your parents died in a car accident. You have no other living relatives. You were placed in foster care until age 18, when you graduated from high school. At age 18, you began working two minimum wage jobs at fast food restaurants. The jobs had no benefits. You have never had medical insurance. You were married to Fred Weasley at 21.<br />&hellip;<br />You decide that you must divorce Fred. You text his old iphone number to ask if he will consent to the divorce. He responds that he will do so only if you give him half of the current value of the car, or let him use it during the work week. You respond that you need the car to get to your new job in Medford, whereupon he refuses to consent to the divorce. You find out from a friend that Fred is still living at #4 Privet Drive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Yes, the professor loves Harry Potter.) And then the kicker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Figure out how to file for divorce. Submit the paperwork, scanned, to the dropbox.</p>
<p>You may use only the following computer systems to obtain information about the papers needed to proceed with the divorce, as well as the steps you will need to take to proceed with the case: (i) a smart phone, or (ii) a computer at a public library. That means that you may not search the Internet or otherwise use your personal computer, or any computer at Harvard, for the purpose of finding out information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This assignment stressed me out more than almost anything else I had to do for that month. I was already pretty lucky - I had a Cambridge Public Library card, and the library is between my house and school. My roommate has a scanner. But I had no idea how long it would take - or how hard the information might be to find, and that definitely increased the cognitive load of the assignment.</p>
<p>So a couple days before the paperwork was due, I showed up at the Cambridge Public Library right as it opened at 9 AM. I figured I&rsquo;d just waltz right in, and sit down at a computer. There were a couple of other people waiting outside the library at 9 AM, and when the librarians unlocked the doors, we all went it. I went to the computer area, talked to the person at the desk, and was assigned my hour of computer time.</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t too many people waiting when I signed up, but by 15 minutes later, there was a line. I had initially planned to go on a weekday evening. Didn&rsquo;t occur to me that it would be prime time for computer usage and there would probably be a wait. Why?  Well, my last experience using a library computer was in my upper middle class suburban hometown in Connecticut where waiting for a computer was an occasional annoyance, but not a thing that happened very often. Most folks using the computers in Darien were there for convenience, not because it was their primary means of accessing the Internet.</p>
<p>Before getting into the computer lab, my plan had been to pull out my laptop and take notes on the process while I looked things up on the library computer. But given that there were actual people who weren&rsquo;t doing artificially constraining assignments who were waiting to use the library machines, I couldn&rsquo;t in good conscience show off the fact that I had a perfectly good computer and still was preventing them from doing their thing. So I took notes on paper instead.</p>
<p>I Googled around for divorce paperwork and explanations, encountering an interesting problem related to library malware prevention, which I&rsquo;ll be writing about for <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/03/404-day-day-action-against-censorship-libraries-and-schools">404 Day</a>. But by the time I got behind the mouse, I already knew what I was doing. It was the surroundings that seemed strange.  A good reminder that privilege clouds our eyes so much that even the obvious is no longer visible.</p>
<p>Of course, people were waiting to use computers. Of course, there was a complicated system to determine whose turn it was, and of course, there were timers. Because of course, the reality is that Cambridge has poverty, or at least people who need to show up at 9 AM on a Tuesday morning to access the Internet via the public library. It&rsquo;s easy to fall into a bubble and forget.</p>
<p>It also turns out I&rsquo;m pretty terrible at filing for divorce - I, like most of my classmates, missed a fundamental fact about contacting the court that would have led to Angelina Johnson&rsquo;s case being dismissed. I also missed a form, and possibly filed the wrong way for a homeless person? Neither Angelina Johnson nor I stood a chance. That, along with the reminder that the community I interact with regularly is not representative, was a pretty sobering reminder.</p>

		<p>As some of you know, I&rsquo;ve started to take Sundays off, and this is mostly a post to continue to hold myself accountable, and to assure everyone that yes! That&rsquo;s still going on!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found my Saturdays to be more productive, and my Sundays to be much more enjoyable and stress-free.</p>

<p>For those that don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not even using any computer through my Sundays (hilariously dubbed &ldquo;paul-tag&rdquo; by my friends (only Germans would find this funny, though :) )), but my tablet and phone seem to be OK (but I actively avoid email)</p>

<p>If anyone&rsquo;s on the fence, I highly recommend doing this, it&rsquo;s really great.</p>

<p>Some <a href="http://recode.net/2014/03/24/coursera-brings-in-longtime-yale-president-rick-levin-as-ceo/">big news in the MOOC space today</a>. Of the MOOC projects, coursera has always been the best at execution and growth, but this is a big deal. This says to me, that they might just make it across the crest of the hype wave before the wave comes down. </p>

<p>It also makes edx looks somewhat second best. What would be needed to change that? One option would be for edx to make a full commitment to open (sharing all data, all code, really focusing on building community around data and code). It might already be a little late for that (and seem like a reaction) but it’s the kind of bold move that MIT made in 2002 with OCW (fathom was the for-profit alternative back then), upending expectations, changing the landscape.</p>

<p>Edx’s current strategy seems to be, let’s hope that universities will start getting nervous about joining coursera and choose us, because we look less threatening. It is not clear that will actually happen and it’s also a pretty defensive scenario that reminds me of Sakai (it’s hard to manage fast moving technology projects with a committee governance structure). </p>

	<section>
		I was awarded the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/awards/fs-award">Free Software Foundation Award for the Advancement of Free Software</a> this weekend[1]. I'd been given some forewarning, and I spent a bunch of that time thinking about how free software had influenced my life. It turns out that it's a lot.<br /><br />I spent most of the 90s growing up in an environment that was rather more interested in cattle than in computers, and had very little internet access during that time. My entire knowledge of the wider free software community came from a couple of CDs that contained a copy of the jargon file, the source code to the entire GNU project and an early copy of the m68k Linux kernel.<br /><br />But that was enough. Before I'd even got to university, I knew what free software was. I'd had the opportunity to teach myself how an operating system actually worked. I'd seen the benefits of being able to modify software and share those modifications with others. I met other people with the same interests. I ended up with a job writing free software and collaborating with others on integrating it with upstream code. And, from there, I became more and more involved with a wider range of free software communities, finding an increasing number of opportunities to help make changes that benefited both me and others.<br /><br />Without free software I'd have started years later. I'd have lost the opportunity to collaborate with people spread over the entire world. My first job would have looked very different, as would my entire career since then. Without free software, almost everything I've achieved in my adult life would have been impossible.<br /><br />To me, free software means I've lived a significantly better life than would otherwise have been the case. But more than that, it means doing what I can to make sure that other people have the same opportunities. I am here because of the work of others. The most rewarding part of my continued involvement is the knowledge that I am part of a countless number of people working to make sure that others can tell the same story in future.<br /><br />[1] I'd link to the actual press release, but it contains possibly the worst photograph of me in the entire history of the universe<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=30420" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

	<h1>2014-03-23 01:00:00: <a href="http://1l2p.net/2014/03/23/Decisions.html">Making decisions in 7 breaths</a> by 1L2P via <a href="http://1l2p.net/">Philipp Schmidt</a></h1>
	<section>
		<p>I am generally pretty good at making decisions. I try to understand the pros and cons (as much as that is possible or makes sense), ask others for their input, and try to remember that <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good">perfect can become the enemy of good</a>.</p>

<p>But there are some areas in which I consistently feel I spend too much time trying to make a decision and am often stressed by my efforts to “get it right”: ordering food in restaurants and booking airline travel. </p>

<p>I am very passionate about food. I believe that my life offers a fixed and decreasing stock of meal opportunities, and I hate few things more than a bad meal. I agonize over what to pick from a restaurant menu. I consult waiters, only to turn around and doubt their expertise or motives. I review the choice of fellow diners (giving me at least sample size access to their dishes). I don’t shy away from adding people on neighboring tables to the deliberations. I consider my previous and my next meal, and try to decide if the fact that I may only get to try a house speciality once, trumps the unfortunate event that I don’t really feel like eating that particular speciality right that moment. I am generally happy with my choices, but I am not sure all that back and forth really helps me make better decisions. </p>

<p>Airline travel is different. I know that my travel is more comfortable and less expensive because I have spent (too) much time reviewing various options. But I am still not sure it is worth the time. Just some of the factors I try to balance are route (duh), safety (Lufthansa), comfort (not Lufthansa), frequent flier benefits (Lufthansa again) and price. I should add that I generally fly economy which means the ability to access better seats, e.g. emergency exit row seats, is pretty important (Lufthansa again, but also Virgin Atlantic). </p>

<p>In both of these cases I struggle with the combination of imperfect information and the strong desire to make a good decision, which makes it difficult to calculate at which point further effort only produces diminishing returns. As Ghost Dog, in the wonderful Jim Jarmusch film, says one should make decisions <a href="http://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ghost_Dog:_The_Way_of_the_Samurai">within the space of 7 breaths</a>. I always loved that principle, even though I so thoroughly struggle to apply it my choice of burger. Or maybe rather the Reuben sandwich? And I don’t think one should really make all decisions within 7 breaths (especially if those breaths have even a hint of bourbon in them). </p>

<p>In any case, I started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0446504114?pc_redir=1395427836&amp;robot_redir=1">The Art of Choosing</a> which, I hope, will provide both intellectual grounding and some real world examples. I think I’ll go with the Reuben… </p>

		<h1 id="not-a-huge-fan">Not a huge fan</h1>

<p>For someone interested in learning, becoming an expert is a very dangerous thing. I the words of Frank Lloyd Wright “an expert is a man who has stopped thinking because ‘he knows.’”</p>

<p>Yet the education and learning experts are occupied trying to measure and compare ‘what we know’. Is that the right approach? We will have aquired some stock of knowledge by the time we are tested - at age 5, 10, or 15 - but is our performance truly a reliable predictor of our future learning? I am more interested in what someone is capable of knowing in the future - a function of our a ability to ask questions and pursue their answers. A function of our curiosity. Trying to do well on the standardized tests might diminuish our sense of curiosity, because instead of following our own passions, we focus on mastering a stock of knowledge that others decided was important. </p>

<p>This is where the whole learning analytics and measurement frameworks come crashing down. Because it isn’t even possible to “measure” curiosity. The simple attempt makes it disappear.</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>I was inspired to write about amateurs by today’s <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/03/12/austin-kleon-show-your-work/">brainpickings post</a> and by my experience speaking at the congress of the German Association of Learning Sciences (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Erziehungswissenschaften). I started off by saying that I was not a huge fan of experts and went on to talk about peer learning. Some of the experts in the room didn’t agree and we ended up having a great conversation about the pros and cons of having experts involved in the work of learners. My take aways are that it is important to distinguish between subject matter experts and facilitators, and that I need to set up my definitions of experts and amateurs earlier on in the talk. </p>

<p>Here is to asking more questions. As Esther Dyson’s email footer used to say “Make new mistakes every day”. </p>

	<section>
		I wrote about <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/15948.html">Thunderbolt on Apple hardware</a> a while ago. Since then Andreas Noever has somehow managed to <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/11/28/492">write a working Thunderbolt stack</a>, which awesome! But there was still the problem I mentioned of the device not appearing unless you passed acpi_osi="Darwin" on the kernel command line, and a further problem that if you suspended and then resumed it vanished again.<br /><br />The ACPI _OSI interface is a mechanism for the firmware to determine the OS that the system is running. It turns out that this works fine for operating systems that export fairly static interfaces (Windows, which adds a new _OSI per release) and poorly for operating systems that don't even guarantee any kind of interface stability in security releases (Linux, which claimed to be "Linux" regardless of version until <a href="http://mjg59.livejournal.com/85923.html">we turned that off</a>). OS X claims to be Darwin and nothing else. As I mentioned before, claiming to be Darwin in addition to Windows was enough to get the Thunderbolt hardware to stay alive after boot, but it wasn't enough to get it powered up again after suspend.<br /><br />It turns out that there's two sections of ACPI code where this Mac checks _OSI. The first is something like:<br /><br />if (_OSI("Darwin")) Store 0x2710 OSYS; else if(_OSI("Windows 2009") Store 0x7D9 OSYS; else…<br /><br />ie, if the OS claims to be Darwin, all other strings are ignored. This is called from \_SB._INI(), which is the first ACPI method the kernel executes. The check for whether to power down the Thunderbolt controller occurs after this and then works correctly.<br /><br />The second version is less helpful. It's more like:<br /><br />if (_OSI("Darwin")) Store 0x2710 OSYS; if (_OSI("Windows 2009")) Store 0x7D9 OSYS; if…<br /><br />ie, if the OS claims to be both Darwin <em>and</em> Windows 2009 (which Linux will if you pass acpi_osi="Darwin"), the OSYS variable gets set to the Windows 2009 value. This version gets called during PCI initialisation, and once it's run all the other Thunderbolt ACPI calls stop doing anything and the controller gets powered down after suspend/resume. That can be fixed <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/3/11/618">easily enough</a> by special casing Darwin. If the platform requests Darwin before anything else, we'll just stop claiming to be Windows.<br /><br />Phew. Working Thunderbolt! (<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/3/11/615">Well, almost</a> - _OSC fails and so we disable PCIe hotplug, but that's easy to work around). But boo, no working battery. Apple do something very strange with their ACPI battery interface. If you're running anything that doesn't claim to be Darwin, Apple expose an ACPI Control Method battery. Control Method interfaces abstract the complexity away into either ACPI bytecode or system management traps - the OS simply calls an ACPI method, magic happens and it gets an answer back. If you claim to be Darwin, Apple remove that interface and instead expose the raw ACPI Smart Battery System interface. This provides an i2c bus over which the OS must then speak the Smart Battery System protocol, allowing it to directly communicate with the battery.<br /><br />Linux has support for this, but it seems that this wasn't working so well <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=301365">and hadn't been for years</a>. Loading the driver resulted in modprobe hanging until a timeout occurred, and most accesses to the battery would (a) take forever and (b) probably fail. It also had the nasty habit of breaking suspend and resume, which was unfortunate since getting Thunderbolt working over suspend and resume was the whole point of this exercise.<br /><br />So. I modified the sbs driver to dump every command it sent over the i2c bus and every response it got. Pretty quickly I found that the failing operation was a write - specifically, a write used to select which battery should be connected to the bus. Interestingly, Apple implemented their Control Method interface by just using ACPI bytecode to speak the SBS protocol. Looking at the code in question showed that they never issued any writes, and the battery worked fine anyway. So why were we writing? SBS provides a command to tell you the current state of the battery subsystem, including which battery (out of a maximum of 4) is currently selected. Unsurprisingly, calling this showed that the battery we wanted to talk to was already selected. We then asked the SBS manager to select it anyway, and the manager promptly fell off the bus and stopped talking to us. In keeping with the maxim of "If hardware complains when we do something, and if we don't really need to do that, don't do that", <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/3/11/645">this makes it work</a>.<br /><br />Working Thunderbolt and working battery. We're even getting close to getting switchable GPU support working reasonably, which is probably just going to involve rewriting the entirety of fbcon or something similarly amusing.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=29954" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

  <li>Banana Ice Cream</li>
  <li>Simple Seitan</li>
  <li>Seitanic Red and White Bean Jambalaya: This will feed me all week. Not sure why I decided it was a good idea to make beef-style seitan instead of chicken for this -- next time will be chicken. In case you're wondering, this recipe won't fit in your large cast iron skillet. I ordered a Dutch Oven so next time I won't have to split it between 2 9x13 pans for the baking.</li>
  <li>Herb Scalloped Potatoes: Really not impressed with this recipe -- scalloped potatoes need to be seasoned and sauced between layers, not just once over the top layer. Came out looking pretty but tasting bland.</li>

		I've spent a while trying to make GPU switching work more reliably on Apple hardware, and got to the point where my Retina MBP now comes up with X running on Intel regardless of what the firmware wanted to do (test patches <a href="http://www.codon.org.uk/~mjg59/tmp/switcheroo">here</a>. But in the process I'd introduced an additional GPU switch which added another layer of flicker to the boot process. I spent some time staring at driver code and poking registers trying to figure out how I could let i915 probe EDID from the panel without switching the display over and made no progress at all.<br /><br />And then I realised that nouveau already has all the information that i915 wants, and maybe we could just have the Switcheroo code hand that over instead of forcing i915 to probe again.

	<section>
		<p>While discussing book reading habits with a few people recently, I came to the realization that I tend to read a lot of non-fiction, and that non-fiction has shaped how I live my life and view the world. I wanted to share some books that I&rsquo;ve read (skewed in favor of the past few years, when I started keeping better track of what I&rsquo;ve read) that I have found particularly meaningful for me.</p>
<p>It was hard for me to narrow down the list, but I managed to get it down to 10 books. In no particular order:</p>
<ul><li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Edition/dp/0061353248">Predictably Irrational</a> by Dan Ariely:</strong> this was one of the first books about behavioral psychology I ever read and is a great place to start. Dan does a great job at examining human behavior and debunking common assumptions about presumed human rationality.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography/dp/1439170916">The Emperor of All Maladies</a> by Siddhartha Mukherjee:</strong> this is a fascinating book about the history of cancer. Reading this book teaches the reader the basics behind cancer, cancer biology, cancer treatment, and how cancer has been viewed and funded over the past few centuries.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bonk-Curious-Coupling-Science-Sex/dp/0393334791">Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex</a> by Mary Roach:</strong> This book takes a look at sexuality and sexual practices from the lens of the scientist. Perfect for anyone who thinks science and sex are sexy.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/080701429X">Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning</a> by Viktor E. Frankl:</strong> While it was written in 1946, Viktor&rsquo;s accounts on finding meaning through suffering are still powerful and resonant today. The first half of the book is about his experiences during the Holocaust, and the second half is about applying some of his theory to finding meaning in life.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spillover-Animal-Infections-Human-Pandemic/dp/1480564443">Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic</a> by David Quammen:</strong> this book covers a whole variety of topics related to virology and pathology, bound together as a series of narratives, with chapters on diseases such as AIDS, ebola, SARS, and influenza.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Is-Everybody-Passionate-Politics/dp/0896086283">Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics</a> by bell hooks:</strong> This is a great introduction to feminism that is easy to read and addresses a lot of common questions, concerns, and misconceptions about it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gutbliss-10-Day-Toxins-Digestive-Baggage/dp/1583335226">Gutbliss: A 10-Day Plan to Ban Bloat, Flush Toxins, and Dump Your Digestive Baggage</a> by Dr. Robynne Chutkan:</strong> Click-baity title, awesome book. I highly recommend that every woman read this book, particularly anyone who has experienced GI problems now or in the past.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Equations-Creating-Happiness-Business/dp/1451607261">Emotional Equations: Simple Steps for Creating Happiness + Success in Business + Life</a> by Chip Conley:</strong> Another kind of click-baity titled, but otherwise great book. Chip breaks down common sets of emotions into &ldquo;equations.&rdquo; Each chapter discusses a different equation or group of equations. While it might seem reductionist, it provides a lot of interesting food for thought.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Tao-Pooh-Benjamin-Hoff/dp/0140067477">The Tao of Pooh</a> by Benjamin Hoff:</strong> this book is cute and fun to read while actually addressing relevant and meaningful issues in life. Benjamin&rsquo;s examination of Pooh and Taoism really made me think about why I viewed the world the way I did.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiate-Agreement-Without/dp/0743526937">Getting to Yes: How To Negotiate Agreement Without Giving In</a> by Roger Fisher:</strong> This is a great introduction to mutual gains negotiation. Life is all about effective communication and working to get what is right for you. This book teaches you how to achieve your goals while maintaining or even enhancing relationships with others.</li>
</ul><p>Would love to hear if anyone has read these books and would like to discuss them, and/or has recommendations.</p>

	<section>
		<h1 id="curious-learner">Curious Learner</h1>

<p>I like the term curious, because it describes both seeking knowledge, and a certain level of weirdness. I am a curious learner. I find it hard to stay within the confines of one discipline. </p>

<p>I also associate curiousity with the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com">New Yorker</a>. I suspect the main reason why I have been a passionate subscriber for many years is that the magazine exercises my curiosity. There have been numerous times when I found myself absorbed in a long article on a topic I thought I had no interest in - only to discover that <strong>everything is interesting</strong>.</p>

<p>Relatively little is known about curiosity. We have some beginning theories about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity#Brain">how it works</a>, but not much more. What is the relationship between learning and curiosity? Is curiosity the fire that feeds our motivation for learning? How could we describe different levels of curiosity (some people seem more curious than others, but how could we describe the difference)? Is curiosity an important evolutionary trait? </p>

<p>One thing we seem to know is that <a href="http://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260%2811%2901692-X/fulltext">declining curiosity is a reliable predictor for Alzheimer’s</a>.</p>

<p>Curiosity itself is a little curious. As one participant at the recent Pearson event at the MIT Media Lab remarked, some of the most important skills or dispositions can’t be tested. Asking someone to demonstrate their level of curiosity for a topic, makes it impossible to determin if the curiosity is genuine or not (even if it was genuine, by trying to observe it, it is not invisible). We can maybe observe it in retrospect, but even knowing that it might be observed in the future, makes curiosity hide from us. I find that fascinating. </p>

	<section>
		<p>There are very few Internet services that I’m actively an evangelist for – Twitter is one, because I’ve met so many cool people through it. The other that I’m always trying to convert people to is Rdio, which is a music streaming service. <!-- more -->First off, yes, it&rsquo;s like Spotify. I can’t actually say that it’s better than Spotify because I’ve never used Spotify. (Back when I was making the switch to not owning my music, Spotify required Facebook log-in and that was a deal breaker for me.) </p>
<p>What I love about Rdio is that it actually does sharing in a way that’s helpful rather than just gratuitous, and it leads to an element of spontaneity and discovery. Rdio has a follower system – it’s much like Twitter, where there are big name bands but you can also follow friends. It’s not reciprocal (yay!), and you can follow people’s playlists without following them personally.</p>
<p>So why does this matter? Well, in some ways, it doesn’t. Knowing that my friend in Portland is listening to Band of Horses is pretty useless to me. However, Rdio shows which of your friends have listened to a given album next to the title, and puts together a collection of the most listened to as your home page (heavy rotation).</p>
<p><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/0a8936309469f6b8433a29c7ce2aa120/tumblr_inline_n1u1rhWs761rrgb56.png" /></p>
<p>Using Heavy Rotation, I can discover new music based on a shared understanding of my friends’ musical taste. For example, I know that if 5 or more of the people I follow have listened to an album, I’ll probably love it – the number of people who share my musical taste on my list is high enough so that’s just how it works. I can also triangulate a guess on whether I’ll like a band or not based on which friends have listened to it. That’s pretty cool. </p>
<p>If a new album comes out and all of my friends are listening to it, I see that as soon as I open up the application. Rdio does try to do notifications of new albums, but since the catalog is always getting backfilled, the heavy rotation method of notification is better.</p>
<p>There are some downsides to using Rdio exclusively. Unlike Spotify, it doesn’t allow you to upload tracks – and there are still some gaps in its catalog (Metric’s Fantasies is the biggest one, After The Disco is my current source of frustration). If you want to own your own music, obviously, this isn’t a good solution. </p>
<p>But I listen to so much more music now that I did before I started using Rdio, and I discover so many more new bands – which I tend to go see live (it integrates with Last.FM and Songkick). So hey, chalk this up to another win for all-you-can-eat streaming services.</p>

<p> Interruptions seem like a big problem; interruptions that make me
look away, or interruptions in my brain, where I might realize I've
not been paying attention for some amount of time. Maybe they
should have navigation buttons similar to video players, so you can
skip backward 15 seconds at a time. I also do want to go back and
review previous pages sometimes for reasons that have nothing to do
with interruption, so I wouldn't want word-by-word to be the only way to
view a text -- especially when reading nonfiction. I might event want
it to work in a mode where you hold down the button on the side of
your phone or tablet in order to move the words, and then have them
automatically pause when you release. It feels like I'd want a lot of
short breaks when reading in this style. </p>

<p>It should also be <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>, but
unfortunately I'm guessing it won't be. I hope someone will make a
free software application along these lines -- the basics seem pretty basic.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wjsullivan/~4/-q3bru1BFmg" width="1" />

	<section>
		<h1 id="the-technology-we-use-to-run-lcl2">The Technology we use to run LCL2</h1>

<p><a href="http://learn.media.mit.edu">Learning Creative Learning</a> is a collaboration between the MIT Media Lab and Peer 2 Peer University. Last year we ran the course for 25,000 educators largely on G+ communities and Google Hangouts (and we hosted a static website on heroku). This year we decided to make some changes. </p>

<p>Dirk Uys, the P2PU tech lead, asked me a few questions about the technology choices we had made and we ended up “talking” on a hackpad. I thought this information might be interesting for other people, and decided to export the hackpad as markdown and paste it below. I used the very nifty Chrome extension for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hackpad-downloader/jhkfiecgggifjcoliemlcajokapmcpih?hl=en">hackpad downloads</a> (which has a few small bugs, e.g. it doesn’t handle multi-level lists very well yet). </p>

<p>This is NOT the definitive technology spec for the course. It’s just our thinking right now. We will learn things along the way and make changes. If you have questions about the technology, feel free to leave a comment below or post in the <a href="http://discuss-learn.media.mit.edu">course discussion forum</a>.</p>

<p>Where is the course site hosted?</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s a Jekyll site hosted as Github Pages</li>
  <li>Threaded discussion on individual pages is provided through disqus</li>
</ul>

<p>Are you using the site as a blog, static content or both? Will weekly communication be posted to the site?</p>

<ul>
  <li>We will post the emails we send out on the course home page. We will also add a full syllabus (which is currently under development).</li>
</ul>

<p>Where does community discussion happen?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discourse. [](http://discuss-learn.media.mit.edu)<a href="http://discuss-learn.media.mit.edu">http://discuss-learn.media.mit.edu</a> (hosted on AWS)</li>
</ul>

<p>Are you concerned about the two separate discussion tools, disqus and discourse?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not really. We are minimizing the use of disqus. It’s just a way to leave comments on the static pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are you using for signup?</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is no “official” sign-up for the course, but we are asking people to register their email address for a MailChimp mailing list if they want updates and notifications about the course. </li>
  <li>Side note: MailChimp makes sense, because your account can be linked to Mandrill, and Mandrill is the default mail handling service for Discourse - so we don’t have to deal with many different services). On the other hand MailChimp had a server problem last night ;-)</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you plan on doing pre/post course surveys? If so, using what tools?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, but haven’t decided on tools. Some of the options we’ve been discussing include pop-up questionnaires before and after unhangout sessions, or more traditional surveys that are sent out via email (link to the survey). We are also interested how we could collect some user data through discourse, but have not found a great solution. Some people are using Topics for people to reply with Yes or No for simple polling. </li>
</ul>

<p>What data are you gathering?</p>

<ul>
  <li>TBD</li>
  <li>Basic google analytics on the site</li>
  <li>Mail-Chimp stores sign-up data</li>
  <li>We will also keep a record of use of unhangouts (users log-in with their Google ID)</li>
  <li>Question back: Does Discourse keep a history of user log-in and activity? I know that it calculates your user level based on time on site (in addition to other factors) so it does “know” how often and for how long you are on the site.</li>
  <li>I don’t know what it gives you automatically and I’m unsure of what it stores in the db - I think it does try to give some stats relevant to a community.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are you doing any specific experiments during this course?</p>

<ul>
  <li>We are (again) trying to experiment with grouping. </li>
  <li>We are also trying to use “protocols” for break-out groups in unhangouts</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you explain what a protocol for the break-out groups looks like?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not yet. It’s one of the things we want to experiment with. But we recently found out about the “protocols” that High Tech High use for their teacher training and we think we can learn a lot from their work. </li>
</ul>

<p>How will you group users or will they group themselves?</p>

<ul>
  <li>That’s a big unanswered question. The overall goal is twofold: better groups than would be achieved by randomly grouping users; and giving users agency in the grouping process.</li>
</ul>

<p>How will groups communicate with each other? Will this communication be private to the group?</p>

<ul>
  <li>We don’t know yet. </li>
</ul>

<p>What are you planning to use to facilitate feedback?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Overall feedback about the course and how it works will take place in the “About this Forum” category on Discourse that we hope people will use to discuss the community. </li>
</ul>

<p>Will learners have some sort of profile? Or would you encourage them to update some profile in a certain way (ex. add a project or something to their profile on linkedin).</p>

<ul>
  <li>We won’t host a profile beyond the very basic profile provided by Discourse. If there was an easy and elegant way of extending that, I think we would prefer to be able to host more information. </li>
  <li>Do you think people taking this course would have an online profile somewhere else that they manage themselves?
    <ul>
      <li>I am not sure. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What happens with discourse after the course? How long do you host it?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indefinitely. We are designing LCL2 as a pathways into the creative learning community, not as a course that starts and then just ends. </li>
</ul>

<p>Where is the content hosted? Is there content? </p>

<ul>
  <li>The website is hosted on Github Pages.</li>
  <li>The syllabus will be a static HTML page (we are still considering to embed a GDoc, but will probably not do that) on the course site. </li>
  <li>There will be videos as well. They will be available “live” through unhangouts. And archived through youtube. </li>
  <li>Readings and other resources are linked to.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the primary user experience for learners? Sign up -&gt; get email when course starts -&gt; get weekly email? or discover discussions on twitter,etc -&gt; join discuss community -&gt; participate?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I imagine different users will have different experiences, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Traditional learner: Sign-up, get emails, join “live” seminar (or watch recording), do activity, share on discourse</li>
      <li>Opportunistic learner: Find course overview on course home, join some of the seminars, participate in some of the activities, use discourse for general discussion, not only tied to activities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What is the main entry point for users? The mailchimp list or joining the discourse community? (probably ties into above)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both ;-) We expect new users to go via [](http://learn.media.mit.edu)http://learn.media.mit.edu and then choose their preferred pathways.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are you planning on using something like badges?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not at this point. </li>
</ul>

<p>Are people creating things again like the previous time with Scratch and other tools?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes. The course is based around weekly activities, some of which use tools like Scratch. </li>
</ul>

<p>Will it produce links that the users can post somewhere? Where? Can we scrape the links? Will it be useful if we can?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users will most likely post links, and share resources on the discussion forum. I’m not sure if Discourse allows automatic scraping of links, but that shouldn’t be too hard. </li>
</ul>

<p>What is your measure for success for this course? big community? lots of eyeballs on content? lots of discussion?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number of participants at live events</li>
  <li>Quality of discussion on discourse</li>
  <li>Number of projects that emerge from phase II (which we haven’t talked about so far, and should do at another time)</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the costs associated with setting up the tech resources, running it and maintaining it into the future?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some time of graduate students at the Lab, some of my time, minimal hosting costs (MailChimp is probably the most expensive at the amount of messages that we are sending. My guess is that over 2-3 months, we’ll probably end up paying about 500 USD for email delivery services). </li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any specific plans to distribute content in other language?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No. But it would be wonderful to see translations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Will you address accessibility  - transcribe videos, make sure the content is compatible with a screen reader, etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is a big issue and we take it very seriously. YouTube does a fair job with initial transcripts, but there is room for improvement. Other solutions unfortunately are still very expensive. If anyone has good ideas for this space, I’d love to talk more. </li>
</ul>

<p>I am super happy to announce that we soft launched the <a href="http://coat.media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab Coat site</a> yesterday.</p>

<p>It’s a project I have been working on almost since arriving at the Lab. I thought it was a crazy idea, I liked the name, and when I met Chris Bevans at the first Director’s Fellows meeting and realized he was a fashion designer, I thought it might just work.</p>

<p>Thanks to the hard work of Chris and his team, and Pip Mothersill and Laura Perovich at the Lab, the Lab Coat is becoming a reality. We are currently manufacturing the first 8 prototypes, including one that Joi Ito will wear at <a href="http://sxsw.media.mit.edu">SxSW</a>.</p>

<p>More details are on the <a href="http://coat.media.mit.edu">Media Lab Coat website</a>. </p>

<p>Special thanks to Srishti Sethi for helping to wrangle the HTML and CSS and integrating the great sign-up feature. </p>

	<section>
		<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://maggiedelano.tumblr.com/post/77680260829/rescue-time-and-the-pomodoro-technique">this</a> post, I was busy this past week and did not get to spend dedicated time exercising for the MIT <a href="http://getfit.mit.edu">Get Fit</a> competition. I did bike or walk to campus every day, though, and decided to go back and log those minutes from the week. It was hard to remember which days I biked and where I had been (even with reviewing my calendar), but then I remembered I have the <a href="http://www.moves-app.com/">Moves app</a> on my phone. Moves on the iPhone 5S logs walking, running, biking and location data that give you an interesting snapshot of your day. I was able to just go back and review how long I cycled / walked each day (I&rsquo;m willing to count walking I do by myself because I walk pretty briskly), and log all of my minutes for the week in about 5 minutes total.</p>
<p>So there you have it: Moves app, the exercise tracker for busy people.</p>

	<section>
		Piston, an Openstack-in-a-box vendor[1] are a sponsor of the Red Hat[2] Summit this year. Last week they <a href="http://www.crn.com/news/cloud/300071815/red-hat-kicks-openstack-startup-piston-cloud-out-of-upcoming-conference.htm">briefly ceased to be</a> for no publicly stated reason, although it's been sugggested that this was in response to Piston winning a contract that Red Hat was also bidding on. This situation didn't last for long - Red Hat's CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/addvin/statuses/436918449349341185">tweeted</a> that this was an error and that Red Hat would pay Piston's sponsorship fee for them.<br /><br />To Red Hat's credit, having the CTO immediately and publicly accept responsibility and offer reparations seems like the best thing they could possibly do in the situation and demonstrates that there are members of senior management who clearly understand the importance of community collaboration to Red Hat's success. But that leaves open the question of how this happened in the first place.<br /><br />Red Hat is big on collaboration. Workers get copies of the <a href="http://darkmattermatters.com/2009/07/29/sharing-your-brand-story-and-heres-ours/">Red Hat Brand Book</a>, an amazingly well-written description of how Red Hat depends on the wider community. New hire induction sessions stress the importance of open source and collaboration. Red Hat staff are at the heart of many vital free software projects. As far as fundamentally Getting It is concerned, Red Hat are a standard to aspire to.<br /><br />Which is why something like this is somewhat unexpected. Someone in Red Hat made a deliberate choice to exclude Piston from the Summit. If the suggestion that this was because of commercial concerns is true, it's antithetical to the Red Hat Way. Piston are a contributor to upstream Openstack, just as Red Hat are. If Piston can do a better job of selling that code than Red Hat can, the lesson that Red Hat should take away is that they need to do a better job - not punish someone else for doing so.<br /><br />However, it's not <em>entirely</em> without precedent. The most obvious example is the change to kernel packaging that happened during the RHEL 6 development cycle. Previous releases had included each individual modification that Red Hat made to the kernel as a separate patch. From RHEL 6 onward, all these patches are merged into one giant patch. This was intended to <a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/news/archive/2011/3/commitment-to-open">make it harder for vendors like Oracle to compete with RHEL</a> by taking patches from upcoming RHEL point releases, backporting them to older ones and then selling that to Red Hat customers. It obviously also had the effect of hurting other distributions such as Debian who were shipping 2.6.32-based kernels - bugs that were fixed in RHEL had to be separately fixed in Debian, despite Red Hat continuing to benefit from the work Debian put into the stable 2.6.32 point releases.<br /><br />It's almost three years since that argument erupted, and by and large the community seems to have accepted that the harm Oracle were doing to Red Hat (while giving almost nothing back in return) justified the change. The parallel argument in the Piston case might be that there's no reason for Red Hat to give advertising space to a company that's doing a better job of selling Red Hat's code than Red Hat are. But the two cases aren't really equal - Oracle are a massively larger vendor who take significantly more from the Linux community than they contribute back. Piston aren't.<br /><br />Which brings us back to how this could have happened in the first place. The Red Hat company culture is supposed to prevent people from thinking that this kind of thing is acceptable, but in this case someone obviously did. Years of Red Hat already having strong standing in a range of open source communities may have engendered some degree of complacency and allowed some within the company to lose track of how important Red Hat's community interactions are in perpetuating that standing. This specific case may have been resolved without any further fallout, but it should really trigger an examination of whether the reality of the company culture still matches the theory. The alternative is that this kind of event becomes the norm rather than the exception, and it takes far less time to lose community goodwill than it takes to build it in the first place.<br /><br />[1] And, in the spirit of full disclosure, a competitor to my current employer<br />[2] Furthering the spirit of full disclosure, a former employer<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=29511" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

<p>Mindfulness is a hot topic. And has been for the past 2500 years. But the resurgent interest is more likely related to our love/hate relationship with social media than rediscovery of ancient wisdoms. </p>

<p>Overwhelmed by the constant demand of our electronic devices. Puzzled by the irresistible pull of checking for an update, a new email, a reply to one of our posts. We certainly seem to be more distracted. Couples sitting in restaurants staring at their screens. People sending text messages while watching a movie. </p>

<p><img alt="Mindfulness" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-01-29-dfdfdfdfdfdgreeeeIMAGE1.jpg" /></p>

<p>I am thinking (actively, not in a detached way) about mindfulness, because of a lecture by Judson Brewer, a clinical psychologist and expert in the field. Judson is also experienced in meditation and has been practicing his own mindfulness and studying the opportunities that mindfulness offers. </p>

<p>The lecture was part of a course titled <a href="http://wellbeing.media.mit.edu/">Tools for Wellbeing</a>, that is organized by Pattie Maes, a Professor and colleague of mine at the <a href="http://media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a>. The syllabus covers a wide range of perspectives on wellbeing and how we can use technology to better understand and improve our own wellbeing. </p>

<p>I took some notes during Judson’s fast-paced and dense talk. This is not a summary, but just a snapshot of some points I noted along the way. About half-way through I also realized the irony of trying to take notes during a talk on mindfulness, and by doing so, being decidedly not mindful. </p>

<h1 id="behaviors-and-re-enforcement">Behaviors and re-enforcement</h1>

<p>A lot of behaviors can be explained as a result of positive or negative re-enforcement. The basic ideas is that:</p>

<p>A cue/trigger is
-&gt; Interpreted as pleasant or unpleasant (based on previous experience)
-&gt; Which leads to craving/wanting 
-&gt; Which leads to an action (giving in or resisting)
-&gt; Through repetition this process and the behavior gets re-enforced</p>

<p>This process let’s us understand how our brain responds to familiar ring-tones on our phone, as well as the desire to light up a cigarette. </p>

<h1 id="mindfulness">Mindfulness</h1>

<p>Mindfulness is on the cover of TIME, but the basic ideas and mindfulness training have been around for ~2500 years. It focuses on two areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attention - Self-regulating attention</li>
  <li>Acceptance - Adopting to the present</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-it-works-helping-people-to-stop-smoking">How it works: Helping people to stop smoking</h1>

<p>Mindfulness training enables smokers to de-couple the stages of “craving/wanting” from “behavior”. That means, instead of designing around it, we can take it out the craving and break down the process. The smoker can observe himself craving a cigarette, but make a decision about smoking that is almost unrelated. It turns out that mindful smoking doesn’t seem all that appealing, even to smokers. When they get the opportunity to pause, block out the craving for a moment, and consider if they really want to smoke a cigarette, many of them are able to simply say no. </p>

<p>And it seems to work. Mindfulness training has success rates that are on par with the most successful approaches to end smoking, yet it has almost no cost. 4 weeks of mindfulness training led to just under 40% of participants successfully giving up smoking. And the long-term effect is a reduction in craving (whereas for people who don’t quit, craving stabilizes, although at a lower level).</p>

	<section>
		I spent last week looking into the firmware configuration protocol used on current IBM system X servers. IBM provide <a href="http://www-947.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/docdisplay?lndocid=tool-asu">a tool</a> called ASU for configuring firmware settings, either in-band (ie, running on the machine you want to reconfigure) or out of band (ie, running on a remote computer and communicating with the baseboard management controller - IMM in IBM-speak). I'm not a fan of using vendor binaries for this kind of thing. They tend to be large (ASU is a 20MB executable) and difficult to script, so I'm gradually reimplementing them in Python. Doing that was fairly straightforward for Dell and Cisco, both of whom document their configuration protocol. IBM, on the other hand, don't. My first plan was to just look at the wire protocol, but it turns out that it's using IPMI 2.0 to communicate and that means that the traffic is encrypted. So, obviously, time to spend a while in gdb.<br /><br />The most important lesson I learned <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/25686.html">last time I did this</a> was "Check whether the vendor tool has a debug option". ASU didn't mention one in its help text and there was no sign of a getopt string, so this took a little longer - but nm helpfully showed a function called DebugLog and setting a breakpoint on that in gdb showed it being called a bunch of the time, so woo. Stepping through the function revealed that it was checking the value of a variable, and looking for other references to that variable in objdump revealed a -l argument. Setting that to 255 gave me rather a lot of output. Nearby was a reference to --showsptraffic, and passing that as well gave me output like:<br /><br />BMC Sent: 2e 90  4d 4f 00 06 63 6f 6e 66 69 67 2e 65 66 69<br />BMC Recv: 00 4d 4f 00 21 9e 00 00<br /><br />which was extremely promising. 2e is IPMI-speak for an OEM specific command, which seemed pretty plausible. 4d 4f 00 is 20301 in decimal, which is the <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers/enterprise-numbers">IANA enterprise number</a> for IBM's system X division (this is required by the IPMI spec, it wasn't an inspired piece of deduction on my behalf). 63 6f 6e 66 69 67 2e 65 66 69 is ASCII for config.xml. That left 90 and 06 to figure out. 90 appeared in all of the traces, so it appears to be the command to indicate that the remaining data is destined for the IMM. The prior debug output indicated that we were in the QuerySize function, so 06 presumably means… query the size. And this is supported by the response - 00 (a status code), 4d 4f 00 (the IANA enterprise number again, to indicate that the responding device is speaking the same protocol as you) and 21 9e 00 00 - or, in rational endianness, 40481, an entirely plausible size.<br /><br />Once I'd got that far the rest started falling into place fairly quickly. 01 rather than 06 indicated a file open request, returning a four byte file handle of some description. 02 was read, 03 was write and 05 was close. Hacking this together with <a href="https://github.com/stackforge/pyghmi">pyghmi</a> meant I could open a file and read it. Success!<br /><br />Well, kind of. I was getting back a large blob of binary. The debug trace showed calls to an EfiDecompress function, so on a whim I tried just decompressing it using the standard UEFI compression format. Shockingly, it worked and now I had a 345K XML blob and presumably many more problems than I'd previously had. Parsing the XML was fairly straightforward, and now I could retrieve the full set of config options, along with the default, current and possible values for them.<br /><br />Making changes was pretty much just the reverse of this. A small XML blob containing the new values is compressed and written to asu_update.efi. One of the elements is a random identifier, which will then appear in another file called config_log along with a status. Just keep re-reading this until the value changes to CM_DONE and we're good.<br /><br />The in-band configuration appears to be identical, but rather than sending commands over the wire they're send through the system's IPMI controller directly. Yes, this does mean that it's sending compressed XML through a single io port. Yes, I'd rather be drinking.<br /><br />I've documented the protocol <a href="http://www.codon.org.uk/~mjg59/imm_protocol.txt">here</a> and hope to be able to release this code before too long - right now I'm trying to nail down the interface a little, but it's broadly working.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=29210" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

	<section>
		<h1 id="open-licenses-still-confused">Open licenses. Still confused.</h1>

<p>It’s Monday morning. I am trying hard to avoid distractions. I close my Gmail window. I make a list of the key goals I want to accomplish this week. I get ready for the P2PU office hour, which is our way to briefly check-in on Monday mornings. </p>

<p>And then a question about CC licenses derails everything. Again. We’ve been here before. And before that. We’ve been here enough times that a little rant is justified. </p>

<p><em>The fact that it is so difficult to understand how the open licenses play with each other, is a sign that the whole system is deeply dysfunctional. It’s a huge waste of time and energy.</em></p>

<h1 id="here-is-what-happened--license-confusion-all-over-again">Here is what happened &gt; License confusion all over again</h1>

<p>This morning we searched the webs for a picture to include in an upcoming report. We assumed that CC BY was ok, even though the report would be licensed as CC BY SA. </p>

<p>When P2PU chose CC BY SA as our default license, we did so mainly for three reasons: (1) So we could include Wikipedia materials, which are licensed CC BY SA, in P2PU courses.  (2) So we could include other more liberally (CC BY) licensed materials in our courses. (3) We thought CC BY SA would provide an extra layer of protection for the materials contributed by our users. (The third point is not relevant to the discussion today).</p>

<p>Back to this morning, when we noticed that the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode">CC BY legal code</a> states that “You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License.” To the non-legal eye that seems to say, you have to always license downstream works as CC-BY. Which is different from what we thought. </p>

<p>Quick question to the twitter verse supported our original reading of the license, e.g. we can combine CC BY licensed materials with our content and license the result as CC BY SA. Or maybe it just shows that others are also confused. </p>

<p><img alt="Twitter Question" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/920614/Blog-Images/cc-by-or-not.png" /></p>

<h1 id="here-is-whats-important--its-a-waste-of-time">Here is what’s important &gt; It’s a waste of time</h1>

<p>The details of what’s possible and what’s not are actually not relevant to my point. What’s important is that we spend (waste) our time trying to figure out how the different open licenses play together. </p>

<p>Yet, we are all on the side of open, and ultimately our positions are much closer to each other than to the opposite side of the spectrum, e.g. all rights reserved. How can we get over the subtle differences in our positions, and work together to pick the real fight. It’s like endless arguments with your neighbor while the landlord gets ready to evict both of you. </p>

<h1 id="it-doesnt-have-to-be-this-way--open-or-not-open">It doesn’t have to be this way &gt; Open or not open!</h1>

<p>Can we (on the open side) not just compromise and pick one license, either CC BY or CC BY SA and then there is only one choice to make: all-rights-reserved or open. It will be clear what open means. </p>

<p>I would love to see Creative Commons reboot and support only one license. </p>

	<section>
		<p><strong>Director’s Fellow Marko Ahtisaar at the Media Lab</strong></p>

<p>These are my (rough) notes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marko_Ahtisaari">Marko Ahtisaari’s</a> talk at the Media Lab on Feb 4, 2014. </p>

<p>Marko Ahtisaari is the latest Media Lab Director’s Fellow. He is an incredible designer, thinker and musician. Marko just started his fellowship year and spoke to the Lab about his current interest in the question: “How to lead your creative self”</p>

<p>He covered three broad areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your week</li>
  <li>Your energy</li>
  <li>Your habits</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="your-week---basic-everyday-behavior">Your week - Basic everyday behavior</h1>

<p>Based on work done when Helsinki was Design Capital of the world, Marko presented a redefined 9 to 5 work week:</p>

<p><strong>Do 4 hours of good work</strong></p>

<p>“good” = meaningful and give you satisfaction</p>

<p><strong>Set 3 goals a week</strong></p>

<p>could be two professional ones, one private one</p>

<p><strong>Use 2 steps to clear your mind</strong></p>

<p>implementing the filtering part of the GTD methodology
make gaps in the day to work through the list of things</p>

<p><strong>Focus on 1 big creative question a day</strong></p>

<p>give yourself permission to think of one big question per day
you can keep a question for another day, 
but you can’t add a second question today</p>

<p>[Marko mentioned that there is scientific grounding for all of these.]</p>

<h1 id="your-energy">Your energy</h1>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Predictably and consistently performing at very high performance</p>

<p><strong>Key:</strong> Physical activity &amp; recovery</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increase your basic movement to 8k steps / day (more important than heavy exercise)</li>
  <li>To live longer, sleep more</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes Marko made to his routing: </p>

<ul>
  <li>4 * 20 min walking = 8000 steps (started having walking meetings)</li>
  <li>30 min screen free time before sleep (radically improves quality of sleep)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="your-habits">Your habits</h1>

<p>Based on work by Marshall Goldsmith (Zen CEO coach) who has written numbers books on the topic including “What got you here, won’t get you there”. </p>

<p>Brutal feedback, and Daily follow-up</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask your peers: What are you good at? What are the annoying habits you have? </li>
  <li>Choose a neutral party to lead the process</li>
  <li>Then work on your annoying habits</li>
  <li>Set up an accountability partner (who asks you the same questions every day: did you do the things you set out to change?)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-now">What now?</h1>

<p>Marko’s current interest is designing the context and conditions in which teams can consistently achieve high-performance creative work. The things he is interested in range from wellness and mindfulness, to group dynamics and reflective practices.</p>

<p>As Marko himself acknowledges, it’s easy to get lumped in with the self-help section of your local book store, when you start talking about things like cybernetics or wellness. But that’s not where Marko is going with this. He is interested in what we can truly understand about how humans are creative, but he isn’t afraid to look across the disciplines. </p>

<p>He allows himself (and invites us) to explore this question broadly, which I find compelling. Because the answers are most likely to be found in the blind spots of the silo-ed academic world. Better understanding the brain and engaging deeply with philosophers who worked hundreds of years ago, go hand in hand. </p>

<h1 id="related---feeling-in-control-and-health">Related - Feeling in control and health</h1>

<p>As Marko was speaking, I remembered the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Marmot">Michael Marmot</a> at University College London that I read about in the wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Choosing-Sheena-Iyengar/dp/B0085RZDMK">The Art of Choosing</a>. Prof Marmot studies the effects that work has on health, and found that employees who feel they don’t have control over their work (Marko’s description of the flood of email that drives our work made me think about this) has significant negative health effects. </p>

	<section>
		<h1 id="the-peer-learning-pyramid-scheme">The Peer Learning Pyramid (Scheme)</h1>

<p><em>[This is a draft. I appreciate comments or feedback, in the comments below, on twitter or by email]</em></p>

<p>A lot of people wonder if peer learning really works. Don’t we need experts to learn from? Can the (proverbially) blind really lead the blind? Those are good questions, but there is another set of questions about peer learning that doesn’t get asked very much. How do we manage to scale learning and education for a growing global population, and how can peer learning help with that? </p>

<p>The first question. Peer learning works, because knowledge is not poured into our heads by an expert, but constructed by ourselves. We do that by tinkering with new ideas, trying them out, practicing their application, and observing ourselves in the process. All of these steps benefit from collaboration with others. Peers can give us feedback on our works in progress, they can support us when we run low on motivation or struggle with a particularly hard problem, and they can hold up a useful mirror in which we can observe ourselves. Secondly, peers are likely to be closer to our own situation - they can emphasize with the problems we encounter, and explain their solution in ways that make sense to us - better than an expert who often can’t remember asking the (mundane) questions that we may ask. </p>

<p>Still not convinced that peer learning works? Please have a look at the Harvard Assessment Study that showed the most reliable indicator of success for a Harvard college student is her/his ability to form or join a study group. Harvard!</p>

<p>Recently I have been more interested in the second question. As our global population grows more people need access to education. We know that the traditional model of building schools and universities, and lecturing, doesn’t scale to accommodate the Billions about to arrive in front of the gates. Some hope that technology will scale education, so that every student can be guided by smart devices, through personalized learning pathways towards a perfect score on a standardized test. In that world, we (who this “we” is, isn’t entirely clear) know exactly what everyone should learn, and we can improve efficiency of how we learn it. The emphasis is on efficiency. Not on learning. </p>

<p>Peer learning, enabled by technology, offers a more compelling alternative. To be clear, I am not at all against technology. I am for a particular type  of technology, technology that brings together people, and ideas, and that makes it easier to collaborate and connect. In other words, I hope technology can help us scale great learning that happens between people. </p>

<p>This is where the pyramid comes in. Imagine expertise as a pyramid for a moment. The person at the top knows the most about something, and everyone below knows a little bit less, and so on, until the bottom of the pyramid, where you find those who are just starting out. (Side note: I don’t like the top-down image, but let’s come back to that at some other point) </p>

<p>In order to learn, you need access to a few people around you. Some who are just above your position will know a little bit more than you, but because they are not that different from you, they can emphasize with your questions or problems. Likewise, it doesn’t hurt to be in touch with a few people just below you. As you help them answer the questions you recently answered for yourself, your own knowledge and strategies will become more engrained. Teaching others is one of the best ways of learning. </p>

<p>Having access to the person at the top of the pyramid can be useful occasionally, but the problems and questions they care about are pretty different from your. There is one special case worth mentioning here. Great teachers are often quite far ahead, but in their teaching they essentially “impersonate” someone who is closer to you. And great teachers don’t scale, because they can’t talk to everyone in the pyramid below. </p>

<p>The nice thing about this model is that at any location in the pyramid, you have access to a group of people around you. In other words, the support system needed to learn, is available. To everyone. Peer learning works, and it scales. </p>

<p>Peer learning also helps us learn others things: engaging with others, communicating our ideas, and trying to understand theirs, negotiating different interests and perspectives, and collaborating on join projects. These are the types of non-cognitive skills that may be more important for finding a job and living successful lives. And as the global population rises to somewhere around 10B people, squeezed together on a pretty small planet, getting along with each other, and working together will not be an option, but a necessity. </p>

	<h1>2014-01-26 00:00:00: <a href="http://1l2p.net/2014/01/26/Schmitter.html">The Schmitter Sandwich</a> by 1L2P via <a href="http://1l2p.net/">Philipp Schmidt</a></h1>
	<section>
		<p><strong>The Schmitter.</strong> Philadelphia’s big league sandwich. Or something like that. In fact, the Schmitter is a variation on the famous Philly cheesesteak. It was created at <a href="http://www.mcnallystavern.com/">McNally’s Tavern</a> for a regular guest, who drank nothing but Schmitt beer. </p>

<p>I’ve never had Schmitt beer, but when Anne McNally found out that my last name was Schmidt (close enough) she organized me an honorary Schmitter sandwich t-shirt right away.</p>

<p><img alt="The Schmitter t-shirt" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/920614/Blog-Images/t-shirts.JPG" /></p>

<p>The Schmitter is awesome and all the hype is well deserved. It’s a cheesesteak with grilled salami that is served on a Kaizer Roll with a “secret sauce”. Reading about it, that combination didn’t immediately make sense to me, but as with all great sandwiches, the sum is bigger than its parts. It all comes together beautifully. </p>

<p><img alt="The sandwich" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/920614/Blog-Images/schmitter.JPG" /></p>

<p><img alt="The Schmitter sandwich" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/920614/Blog-Images/the-schmitter-close-up.JPG" /></p>

<p>But even without the Schmitter, McNally’s would be worth the visit. Run by Anne McNally, the grand-daughter of the original founder, everything about it feels exactly right. It’s one of those place that knows what it is, and doesn’t want to be anything else. It’s good and simple food, well prepared, at reasonably prices. It’s full of history, but also always changing and a real part of the local community. Everyone in the place seems to know each other and there is a friendly banter going on between the bar and the dining room, with Anne floating from table to table, cracking a joke or telling a story about her restaurant. </p>

<p>In the early 20th century the Philadelphia trolley (street car) ran all the way out to Chestnut Hill where McNally’s is still located today. Anne’s grand-father worked for the street car and complained that at the end of his work day he could never find decent food. So Anne’s grand-mother set out to do something about that and started serving sandwiches and small dishes out of a little shack called the “Quick Lunch”. Business was good and eventually grew into the restaurant that is still located just across the street from the original shack today.  </p>

<p><img alt="McNallys Outside" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/920614/Blog-Images/mcnallys-outside.JPG" /></p>

<p>Anne McNally took over the restaurant a few years ago (maybe a little surprising given that she has three brothers, two of whom are chefs) and when you see her talking about the Tavern and chatting with patrons you understand why. You can’t imagine anyone doing a better job at keeping the tradition alive, and having a great time doing it. </p>

<p>The Schmitter gets all the attention, but the carrot cake deserves some, too. It’s home baked (and at McNally’s “home-baked” is not just a marketing slogan). Each day at 4am Anne’s sister checks her voice mail to find out how many cakes are left at the Tavern and then bakes more chocolate or carrot cakes for the day. I didn’t get to try the chocolate cake, but managed to squeeze in a slice of carrot cake on top of the Schmitter. It was worth it. Despite the fact that it comes without nuts or raisins (I usually prefer it with) it was exactly what a carrot cake should be - perfect balance between moist and dry, with a generous but not overwhelming layer of frosting. Kira (from John and Kira’s chocolates) says that John and their son are on the quest for the best carrot cake in Philadelphia, and McNally’s is the front-runner. There you have it. </p>

	<section>
		<p><a href="https://twitter.com/meenoorami" title="Meenoo Rami Twitter">Meenoo Rami</a> invited me to come and speak at <a href="http://educonphilly.org/" title="EduCon Home">EduCon</a> and while I am by no means an expert on school reform or teacher professional development (and made that clear to Meenoo before accepting the invitation) I ended up finding a lot of connection points between the questions raised and challenges discussed at the conference, and my own work. </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/schmidtphi/status/427453822999740416/photo/1"><img alt="Educon Philadelphia 2014" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/920614/Blog-Images/educon-twitter.png" /></a></p>

<p>The focus of my panel was openness and transparency, and how they affect schools. We touched on the relationship between open and accountability, the need to protect vulnerabilities in an open environment, and the possibilities for innovation. </p>

<p>I tried to make two points:
* “Open” is a mechanism for change and innovation, that uses networks enabled by technology. Open means you don’t need to ask or wait for permission. You can go ahead and do the things you think are right. 
* Innovation happens at the edges (and EduCon is a good example for the edge) and “open” can amplify the stories coming from innovators, and grow the networks of people who want to participate, to move innovation from the edges into the mainstream. </p>

<p>I believe both of these points are important and resonated with some of the audience, but they also felt a little abstract when faced with the day to day realities of teachers. Paul Allison told me about the school he is helping start-up in New York and how they essentially serve kids that the other schools are trying to get rid of. These are kids who spend months in what sounds like “detention centers” (although I am sure he used a different term) waiting for their cases to be heard. Another teacher told me that she has to balance teaching her students the things she knows will serve them well in the long-term (collaboration, team-work, curiosity) with the things they need for the standardized test. In light of those challenges I wish I had had more concrete “do ABC in order to achieve XYZ” type advice. </p>

<p>From my outsider’s perspective, it looks like the real tragedy is that those teachers and students who are already doing well, will continue to do well. They will get high test scores and still learn the important things that the tests don’t measure. But for the kids who are struggling, and the teachers who might still be learning themselves, the reforms and standardized testing are poison. They incentivize teaching to the test, and the danger is that the test focuses on the wrong skills. There are no quick feedback loops to make sure that someone who does well on the test will be more successful than someone who doesn’t in the long run. Or rather, that because we are focusing so much on these tests, we will fail to provide our students with the skills they really need. There are no quick feedback loops to test the assumptions underlying these reforms.</p>

<p>On a more positive note, something that struck me as a great opportunity is that the best and most successful teachers (measured by any standard, including the standardized test) are those who are most vehemently opposed to the reforms and standardized tests. That is a story that needs to be told more loudly. It should be harder to push aside criticism coming from the teachers who are doing well than from those in struggling schools who are often portrayed as part of the problem themselves. </p>

<p>A quick shout-out for two projects we are involved in that are designed to grow the community of innovative educators:
* <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/" title="Deeper Learning MOOC">The Deeper Learning MOOC</a> is a collaboration with High Tech High, a great school in California. It’s a constructivist MOOC and the community is buzzing with energy - It’s not too late to join!
* <a href="http://learn.media.mit.edu/">Learning Creative Learning 2</a> will be offered again starting in late March. It will be very different than last year. More details soon! </p>

	<section>
		Contributor License Agreements ("CLAs") are a mechanism for an upstream software developer to insist that contributors grant the upstream developer some additional set of rights. These range in extent - some CLAs require that the contributor reassign their copyright over the contribution to the upstream developer, some merely provide the upstream developer with a grant of rights that aren't explicit in the software license (such as an explicit patent grant for a contribution licensed under a BSD-style license).<br /><br />CLAs aren't new. FSF-copyrighted projects have been using copyright assignment since at least 1985 - in return, the FSF promise that the software will always be distributed under a copyleft-style license. For over a decade, Apache Software Foundation projects have required that contributors sign a CLA that allows them to retain copyright, but grants the ASF the right to relicense the work as it wishes. For the most part, this hasn't been terribly controversial.<br /><br />So why do people <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KaySievers/posts/C3chC26khpq">object so much</a> when Canonical do it? I've written about this <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/25376.html">in the context of Mir</a> before, but it's worth expanding on the general case. The FSF's copyright assignment ensures that contributions to GPLed software will only be distributed under GPL-style licenses. The Apache CLA permits the ASF to relicense a contribution under a proprietary license, but the Apache license allows anyone to do that anyway. Going through Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement#Users">list of CLA users</a>, the majority cover projects that are under BSD- or Apache-style licenses, with a couple of cases covering GPLed projects with a promise that any contributions will only be distributed under GPL-like licenses[1]. Either everyone can produce proprietary derivative works, or nobody can.<br /><br />In contrast, Canonical ship software under the GPLv3 family of licenses (GPL, AGPL and LGPL) but require that contributors sign an agreement that permits Canonical to relicense their contributions under a proprietary license. This is a fundamentally different situation to almost all widely accepted CLAs, and it's disingenuous for Canonical to defend their CLA by pointing out the broad community uptake of, for instance, the Apache CLA.<br /><br />Canonical could easily replace their CLA with one that removed this asymmetry - <a href="http://www.harmonyagreements.org/">Project Harmony</a>, the basis of Canonical's CLA, permits you to specify an "inbound equals outbound" agreement that prevents upstream from relicensing under a proprietary license[2]. Canonical's deliberate choice not to do so just strengthens the argument that the CLA is primarily about wanting to produce proprietary versions of software rather than wanting to strengthen their case in any copyright or patent disputes. It's unsurprising that people feel disinclined to contribute to projects under those circumstances, and it's difficult to understand why Canonical simultaneously insist on this hostile behaviour and bemoan the lack of community contribution to Canonical projects.<br /><br />[1] The one major exception is the Digia/Qt project CLA, which covers an LGPLed work but makes it entirely clear that Digia will ship your contributions under proprietary licenses as well. At least they're honest.<br /><br />[2] See the various options in section 2.1(d) <a href="http://www.harmonyagreements.org/docs/ha-cla-i.html">here</a>. Canonical chose option five. If they'd chosen option one instead, this wouldn't be a problem.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=29160" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

	<section>
		<p>What are the limits to measurement? Considering just two examples, GDP and standardized test scores, we have limited ability to measure what matters, but almost unlimited faith in the reliability and importance of our measurements. </p>

<p>GDP is staggeringly imprecise. It doesn’t include the services we provide without payment (such as editing wikipedia or contributing to open source software projects). Likewise, it didn’t include the labour provided by women who looked after children and households until those services were outsourced. It suggests that it is better to work late, get drunk, smash your car and rack up a large hospital bill, than to take the subway home, cook dinner with your family and go to bed after reading bed time stories from library books. Yet, GDP is the de facto measure of economic development (and by proxy success and well-being) and the No. 1 driver of macro economic policy. </p>

<p>The situation is not much better for standardized test scores. They are at best a measure of the student’s ability to do what is expected, and proxy for the development of other more important skills. Thankfully, the schools that are good at preparing students to do well on standardized tests, tend to also be good at providing them with great learning environments. There is no reliable measure of curiosity or creativity, even though those seem to be better guides to a fulfilled and happy (and successful) life than size of vocabulary. Some of the things we care about even disappear when we try to measure them. </p>

<p>In hindsight everything makes sense. Clear patterns emerge and tempt us into predictions of the future. </p>

<p>But does scientific discovery really start with a clear hypothesis, does great impact really start with ambitious goals (such as the often repeated Media Lab mantra of improving 1B peoples lives), and do great investment successes really begin with insightful analysis of the economic dynamics?</p>

<p>Or is the course of human learning, innovation and progress better described as a series of lucky accidents, coincidences, collisions and adaptation?</p>

<p>Deciding which of these models we subscribe to has far-reaching consequences for the design of schools, governments and economies. </p>

So, when <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi</a> and <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/">Mitch</a> gave me an opportunity to build a role at the Lab, I took it. </p>

<p>After more than four years as Executive Director of Peer 2 Peer University the time is right for a change, for me and for P2PU. I will be joining the P2PU board and we will hire a new Executive Director in the first quarter of 2014. This doesn’t mean that I am leaving P2PU, only that I will be taking a slightly different role going forward. I will continue to raise funding, identify new opportunities, develop partnerships and help set the overall strategy. </p>

<p>The move feels right for me, and I also think it’s good for P2PU. For one, it gives the amazing people I work with room to grow into bigger roles. P2PU is a small team (<a href="https://twitter.com/rebamex">Bekka</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dirkcuys">Dirk</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ercchy">Erika</a>, <a href="http://mozzadrella.me/">Vanessa</a>) that has already taken over a lot of the responsibilities that I used to have, when we started out. And we’ve been fortunate to bring on an amazing COO recently. <a href="http://info.p2pu.org/2013/11/25/hello-carl/">Carl</a> has helped us focus and get better at doing the work we love doing, and he is working with the board to manage the ED transition. The timing is good as well. We are on solid financial footing and have a clear strategy where we are going. Finally, for P2PU to have a partner at the Media Lab opens up many opportunities. Over the past year, the collaboration has already allowed us to try out <a href="http://learn.media.mit.edu/">P2PU-style learning in the context of a top research university</a>, given us a much broader audience, and <a href="http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/">introduced us to new collaborators</a>. We will be doing more and bigger things together in the future. </p>

<p>Since I am not leaving, there is no need for soppy words and emotional statements… Agh, screw that. It’s always a good time, to say what’s in your heart. </p>

<p>I am not moving on from P2PU, but I still feel sentimental when I look at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=p2pu">#P2PU picture stream on flickr</a>. And all the memories that they bring back. I am very grateful that I have met some of my best friends through P2PU (you know who you are!), that I got to work with them on some of the most interesting problems I could think of, and that we have had so much fun doing it. </p>

<p>I love that we care about the things we work on, but that we care more about the people we work with (and I mean the entire community here). I love that we’ve always had a sense of humor (even if not everyone thought it was funny). </p>

<p>At one workshop, the post-it note that asked “Should Philipp wear a Cape?” received more votes than the suggestion that P2PU “use new learning models to hack into popular notions of independence and self-reliance”. My kind of people! </p>

<p>I think of the 09/09/09 t-shirt as my cape, and I will always wear it proudly (or try to, because it is getting a little small these days). And yes, that is a terrible picture in which I look positively insane, but who cares, right?</p>

<p><img alt="p2pu-shirt" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2538/3830452429_f11d6ec9de.jpg" /> </p>

<p>People of P2PU, peers, all of you are really very special to me! Thank you! </p>

<p>P </p>

<p>Executive Director Search &gt; The search for a new ED will start in the next few weeks. The best person to contact about the role is board chair Delia Browne and you can reach her via admin@p2pu.org.       </p>

	<section>
		(Discussion of a presentation I gave at <a href="http://www.kiwicon.org">Kiwicon</a> last month)<br /><br />Kexec is a Linux kernel feature intended to allow the booting of a replacement kernel at runtime. There's a few reasons you might want to do that, such as using Linux as a bootloader[1], rebooting without having to wait for the firmware to reinitialise or booting into a minimal kernel and userspace that can be booted on crash in order to save system state for later analysis.<br /><br />But kexec's significantly more flexible than this. The kexec system call interface takes a list of segments (ie, pointers to a userspace buffer and the desired target destination) and an entry point. The kernel relocates those segments and jumps to the entry point. That entry point is typically code referred to as purgatory, due to the fact that it lives between the world of the first kernel and the world of the second kernel. The purgatory code sets up the environment for the second kernel and then jumps to it. The first kernel doesn't need to know anything about what the second kernel is or does. While it's conventional to load Linux, you can load just about anything.<br /><br />The most important thing to note here is that none of this is signed. In other words, despite us having a robust in-kernel mechanism for ensuring that only signed modules can be inserted into the kernel, root can still load arbitrary code via kexec and execute it. This seems like a somewhat irritating way to patch the running kernel, so thankfully there's a much more straightforward approach.<br /><br />I modified kexec to add an additional loader and uploaded the code <a href="https://github.com/mjg59/kexec-tools/tree/mjg_dummy">here</a>. Build and install it. Make sure that /sys/module/module/parameters/sig_enforce on your system is "Y". Then, as root, do something like:<br /><tt>kexec --type="dummy" --address=`printf "0x%x" $(( $(grep "B sig_enforce" /proc/kallsyms | awk '{print "0x"$1}') & 0x7fffffff))` --value=0 --load-preserve-context --mem-max=0x10000 /bin/true</tt><br />to load it[2]. Now do kexec -e and watch colours flash and check /sys/module/module/parameters/sig_enforce again.<br /><br />The beauty of this approach is that it doesn't rely on any kernel bugs - it's using kernel functionality that was explicitly designed to let you do this kind of thing (ie, run arbitrary code in ring 0). There's not really any way to fix it beyond adding <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/11/20/540">a new system call</a> that has rather tighter restrictions on the binaries that can be loaded. If you're using signed modules but still permit kexec, you're not really adding any additional security.<br /><br />But that's not the most interesting way to use kexec. If you can load arbitrary code into the kernel, you can load <em>anything</em>. Including, say, the Windows kernel. ReactOS provides a bootloader that's able to boot the Windows 2003 kernel, and it shouldn't be too difficult for a sufficiently enterprising individual to work out how to get Windows 8 booting. Things are a little trickier on UEFI - you need to tell the firmware which virtual→physical map to use, and you can only do it once. If Linux has already done that, it's going to be difficult to set up a different map for Windows. Thankfully, there's an easy workaround. Just boot with the "noefi" kernel argument and the kernel will skip UEFI setup, letting you set up your own map.<br /><br />Why would you want to do this? The most obvious reason is avoiding Secure Boot restrictions. Secure Boot, if enabled, is explicitly designed to stop you booting modified kernels unless you've added your own keys. But if you boot a signed Linux distribution with kexec enabled (like, say, Ubuntu) then you're able to boot a modified Windows kernel that will still believe it was booted securely. That means you can disable stuff like the Early Launch Anti-Malware feature or driver signing, or just stick whatever code you want directly into the kernel. In most cases all you'd need for this would be a bootloader, kernel and an initrd containing support for the main storage, an ntfs driver and a copy of kexec-tools. That should be well under 10MB, so it'll easily fit on the EFI system partition. Copy it over the Windows bootloader and you should be able to  boot a modified Windows kernel without any terribly obvious graphical glitches in the process.<br /><br />And that's the story of why kexec is disabled on Fedora when Secure Boot is enabled.<br /><br />[1] That way you only have to write most drivers once<br />[2] The address section finds the address of the sig_enforce symbol in the kernel, and the value argument tells the dummy code what value to set that address to. --load-preserve-context informs the kernel that it should save hardware state in order to permit returning to the original kernel. --mem-max indicates the highest address that the kernel needs to back up. /bin/true is just there to satisfy the argument parser.<br /><br /><img alt="comment count unavailable" height="12" src="http://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=mjg59&amp;ditemid=28746" style="vertical-align: middle;" width="30" /> comments

		<p>Mixing C and assembly can result in some truly nasty bugs. Some of the
more obvious things that can go wrong arise when you violate the calling
convention used by the C compiler. Any C compiler will have a set of

function, where the return value is stored, how to return from a

	<section>
		<p><span>Jonathan Zittrain, Larry Lessig and I have been working on a paper laying out some empirical evidence of linkrot and reference rot in law review and Supreme Court citations, and proposing a solution, which is called </span><a href="http://www.perma.cc">Perma.cc</a><span>. </span><span>Our research found that 49% of links in SCOTUS opinions and between 60-70% of journal links are broken - a huge number that only increases as time passes. The full results are available at the draft on </span><span></span><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2329161">SSRN</a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>Given that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/us/politics/in-supreme-court-opinions-clicks-that-lead-nowhere.html?_r=0">New York Times</a> picked up this research, it&rsquo;s about time for me to write something about it. Sorry blog readers, I was scooped.</span></p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just say this: Perma has the potential to save legal scholarship and court opinions from some of the problems the paper mentions. This change, like many changes to legal citation, needs to come from below - from the libraries and journals, and then upwards to the courts. I&rsquo;m thrilled that our empirical work has enough of a shocking numerical value to get folks to pay attention, but even more thrilled that we have a real solution to offer.</p>

	<section>
		<p>So I&rsquo;m done with the <a href="http://www.kendraalbert.com/post/39871400246/new-years-resolution-5-books-a-week">great book reading project of 2013</a>. (As I joked on Twitter, that means I&rsquo;m done reading books forever, right?) I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of recommendations, which are available <a href="http://www.kendraalbert.com/books">here</a>.</p>
<p>Some basic facts:</p>
<ul><li><span>I started January 1st, 2013.</span></li>
<li><span>I finished September 7th, 2013.</span></li>
<li><span>I read 176 books. (That&rsquo;s about 22 per month or a book every 1.4 days.)</span></li>
<li><span>29% of the authors were people of color.</span></li>
<li><span>49% of the authors were women, 51% were men.</span></li>
<li>The furthest behind I got was 16 books. (<a href="http://www.kendraalbert.com/post/53682240194/falling-off-the-wagon">More about that</a>.)</li>
<li><span>I never really got that far ahead; maybe by one book, once or twice.<!-- more --></span></li>
</ul><p>And here&rsquo;s what I learned:</p>
<p>1) I can actually read 5 books a week (or one a day, if I don&rsquo;t have a job).</p>
<p>When I started this project, I theorized that I could read 5 books a week without any real evidence that that was true, other than a rough idea of how long it took me to read a book. It turns out this is in fact a reachable goal, although it put a significant strain on my free time. When I was playing catch up over the summer, I could read a book a day, but it was not actually a ton of fun (despite having nothing but time on my hands.)</p>
<p>2) My hypotheses about my information diet without self-tracking were bullshit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this a little, but before I started keeping track of the diversity goals, I would have estimated I was reading 50/50 male/female authors. This was very much not true. Before I started to make dramatic changes to my reading calculus, it was very easy to reach for popular male authors instead of thinking critically about what I was reading. This goes ever more so for authors who are people of color - it&rsquo;s really easy to read as a scifi/fantasy/pop science fan and not critically examine the types of work you&rsquo;re encountering.</p>
<p>The self-tracking made me more conscious of how I made book choices - much less picking stuff off the shelf randomly, much more deliberative. I still took recommendations from friends, but it was tempered by knowing that I had to meet some more general goals.</p>
<p>I definitely got more and more committed to choosing books based on the diversity goals as I got closer to the end - and this actually meant that some of the books I read in the last month were my favorites. I was actually shocked by how hard it was for me to initially find books that peaked my interest by people of color. I suspect that was mostly because I hadn&rsquo;t thought about my reading habits in those terms, and thus didn&rsquo;t even know where to start. By the end, it was super easy to find more, which I consider possibly the biggest win of the entire thing.</p>
<p>3) It&rsquo;s easy to get into ruts based on what you and your friends read.</p>
<p>See above, to some extent - but I definitely found that most of the recommendations I got from people I trust were for white dudes. It&rsquo;s been really interesting to see how many of my favorite books, and the one&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve been recommending were from authors I had never heard of or read before this year; Octavia Butler and N. K. Jemesin pop to mind as examples.</p>
<p>4) Reading leads to more reading.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the project, I definitely had days where I had no idea what to read next; both from the perspective of not having another book lined up, but also not knowing where to go to look for recommendations. Now I have a huge pile of books I&rsquo;m super excited about (see below).</p>
<p>5) The book requirement led to some interesting incentives.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t thought much at the beginning about how the requirements that the works be books would affect what I read. It changed a lot of my habits - it got to the point where I was just avoiding reading papers, because I knew they wouldn&rsquo;t count towards what I was tracking.</p>
<p>Folks have suggested a word count goal, which would have been a good way to eliminate the weird incentives (books = good, everything else = bad). However, I have no idea how I would have kept track of that. I was fortunate to have Goodreads as a way to keep track of book numbers and my progress - although I&rsquo;m struggling with how to export data from it for analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, what&rsquo;s next? Well, this:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/6e5a49626b76b4e23e27f14b40347040/tumblr_inline_mt6n12w48x1rrgb56.jpg" /></p>
<p><span>That&rsquo;s some textbooks, but also the pile of books that&rsquo;s next on my list.</span></p>
<p>Which brings me to the final lesson:</p>
<p>6) After this summer, the law school reading load is actually pretty light.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an upside I didn&rsquo;t foresee.</p>

	<h1>2013-09-22 03:49:00: <a href="http://notes.pault.ag/debian-python">Musings about Debian and Python</a> by paultag via <a href="http://notes.pault.ag/">Paul Tagliamonte</a></h1>
	<section>
		<p>On a regular basis, I find myself the odd-man-out when it comes to talking
about how to work with Python on Debian systems. I'm going to write this and
post it so that I might be able to point people at my thoughts without having
to write the same email in response to each thread that pops up.</p>
<p>Turns out I don't fit in with the Debian hardliners (which is to say, the
mindset that <code>pip</code> sucks and shouldn't exist), nor do I fit in with the Python
hardliners (which is to say <code>apt</code> and <code>dpkg</code> are out of date, and neither have
a place on a Development machine).</p>
<p>I think our discourse on this topic has become <em>petty</em> and <em>stupid</em> in general.
Let's all try to step back and drop a bit of the attitude.</p>
<h1><code>pip</code> doesn't suck, and neither does <code>apt</code>.</h1>
<p>The truth is, both sides are wrong. As with any subject, the real
answer here is much more nuanced than either side presents it. I'm going to
try and present my opinion on this, in the way that both my Pythonista self
and my Debianite self see the issue. Hopefully I can keep this short, to
the point, and caked with logic.</p>
<h2>The case for <code>dpkg</code> (the Debianite in me)</h2>
<p>In defense of <code>dpkg</code> and <code>apt</code>, imagine having to install <code>python-gnome2</code>
on all your systems when you install.  It'd be hell on earth.
Imagine having a <strong>user</strong> try to do this. It's insane to assume that
end-users will be using <code>pip</code> for this purpose.</p>
<p><code>pip</code> is fun and all, but it's also installing 100% untrusted code to your
system (perhaps as root, if you're using <code>pip</code> with <code>sudo</code> for some reason),
and hasn't been reviewed for software freeness, which is something Debian
(and Debian users) take seriously. This isn't even to mention the hell that
<code>pip</code> wreaks on <code>dpkg</code> controlled files / packages.</p>
<aside class="left">
    Remember, Debian spends a lot of time and effort into ensuring software
    is <a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">DFSG</a>
    free, and safe.
</aside>

<p>Try to remember how much of your system running (yes, right now) is running
because of Python or Python modules. Try to imagine how much of a pain in
the ass it'd be if you couldn't boot into <code>GNOME</code> to use <code>nm-applet</code> to connect
to wifi to <code>pip</code> install something. I'm sure even the most extreme pip'er
understands the need for Operating System level package management.</p>
<p>Debian also has a bigger problem scope - we're not maintaining a library
in Debian for kicks, we're maintaining it so that <em>end user applications</em> may
use the library. When we update something like <code>Django</code>, we have to make sure
that we don't break anything using it (although, to be honest, the fact that we
package webapps is an entire rant for later) before we get to update it to the
newest release.</p>
<p>Hell, with a few coffees, I could automate the process of releasing a <code>.deb</code>
with a new upstream release, 100% unattended. I won't, however, since this is
an insane idea. Let's go over a brief list of things I do before uploading a
new package:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the <em>entire</em> codebase for simple mistakes.</li>
<li>Review the <em>entire</em> codebase for license issues.</li>
<li>Review the <em>entire</em> codebase for files without source, and track down
    (and include source for) any sourceless files (such as <code>pickle</code>
    files, etc).</li>
<li>Get to know the upstream, get to know open bugs, write something using
    the lib, in case I need to debug later.</li>
<li>Install the package.</li>
<li>Test the package.</li>
<li>Work out any Debian package issues (this is easy).</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, a brief list of things I do before I update a package:</p>
<aside class="right">
    Some non-Debian people may call this anal. I disagree, since this is
    important to ensure we have <i>source</i> for all files. In addition,
    it's trivial to take the next step and ensure things are <i>roughly</i>
    safe.
</aside>

<ol>
<li>Review the changes between the last uploaded version (in diff format, if
    it's sane, otherwise get the VCS and review), ensure all the above are still
    OK.</li>
<li>Review for Debian-local issues (such as how it will upgrade, using
    <code>piuparts</code>, and <code>adequate</code>, etc).</li>
<li>Check to make sure it won't break any reverse dependencies.</li>
<li>Review for bugfixes that I might need to bring back to the <code>stable</code> release.</li>
<li>Figure out if I should (or even can) backport the package, if API is
    stable.</li>
<li>Review for bugs (upstream or in Debian) that I need to mention in the
    debian/changelog.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, this isn't a quick-and-dirty task. It's not a matter of getting a
package updated (technically), it's a much more detailed process than that.
This is also why Debian is so highly regarded for its technical virtuosity,
and why the
<a href="http://training.linuxfoundation.org/why-our-linux-training/training-reviews/linux-foundation-training-prepares-the-international-space-station-for-linux-migration">ISS decided to deploy Debian in space</a>,
despite other commercial distros such as <code>Red Hat</code>, or <code>Ubuntu</code>, and
community distros, such as <code>Fedora</code> or <code>Arch</code>.</p>
<aside class="left">
    Cheap shot, I know.
</aside>

<p>It's also not Debian's job to package the world in the archive. This is an
insane task, and it's not Debian's place to do it. We introduce libraries
as things need them, not because we wrote some new library that someone
may find slightly useful at some point in the future. maybe.</p>
<p>Upstream developers and language communities (not only Python here) tend to
lose sight of why we're doing this in the first place, which
is our users. This isn't some sort of technical pissing contest to see who can
distribute the software in the best way. Debian-folk always keep end users
as our highest priority.</p>
<aside class="right">
    I'm sorry to any
    <a href="http://lists.debian.org/20100106100055.GV3438@radis.liafa.jussieu.fr">kittens that may have been harmed by this statement</a>.
</aside>

<p>I quote the
<a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">Debian Social Contract</a>, when I say
that <em>Our priorities are our users and free software</em>. No one's trying to
get <em>developers</em> to use <code>dpkg</code> to create software. In fact, as you'll see
below, I actively <em>discourage</em> using system modules for development.</p>
<h2>The case for <code>pip</code> (the Pythonista in me)</h2>
<p>In defense of <code>pip</code>, the idea that Debian will keep the latest versions of
packages is insane. The idea that we can keep pace with upstream releases is
nuts, and the idea that every upstream release on <code>pypi</code> is ready to ship is
bananas. <a href="http://youtu.be/gZHjRQjbHrE?t=2m30s">b-a-n-a-n-a-n-a-s</a>.
As a developer, I don't want to support every release, and I surely don't want
other people depending on some random snapshot.</p>
<aside class="right">
    In fact, I have a very hard time saying anything but <i>"try upgrading
    first"</i> when I get a bug report on a side-project.
    It's tough to remember some edge-case from 2 years ago if this code is
    tightly coupled with another codebase.
</aside>

<p>Often times, I'll put stuff up on <code>pypi</code> as a preview, or to release often, and
solicit feedback without having to give out instructions on using a <code>git</code>
checkout (it's also easier to have them try a version from <code>pypi</code> so I can
cross-ref the git tag to reproduce issues when they file them)</p>
<aside class="left">
    Even Debian tools I write, like
    <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/schroot">python-schroot</a>
    are released to <code>pypi</code> first, and I treat that as the
    upstream location when packaging it in Debian.
</aside>

<p><code>pypi</code> is easy, ubiquitous and works regardless of the platform, which means
less of my development time is spent packaging stuff up for platforms I don't
really care about (<code>Arch</code>, <code>Fedora</code>, <code>OSX</code>, <code>Windows</code>), even though I value
feedback from users on those systems. The effort it takes to release something
is limited to <code>python setup.py sdist upload</code>, and it's in a place (and in a
shape) that anyone can use it without having 10 sets of platform-local
instructions.</p>
<p>Even ignoring all the above, when <em>I'm</em> writing a new app or bit of code,
I want to be sure I'm targeting the latest version of the code I depend on,
so that future changes to API won't hit me as hard. By following
along with my dependencies' development, I can be sure that my code breaks
early, and breaks in development, not production. Upstreams also tend to not
like bug reports against old branches, so ensuring I have the latest code from
<code>pypi</code> means I can properly file bugs.</p>
<p>Lastly, I prefer <code>virtualenv</code> based setups for development, since I'm usually
working on many things at once. This often means version mismatches in
libraries, which brings in API changes (another whole rant here as well).
I <em>don't</em> want to keep installing and uninstalling packages to switch between
the two projects, and using a <code>chroot(8)</code> means a lot of overhead and that it's
disconnected from my development environment / filesystem, so I resort to
<code>virtualenv</code> to isolate my Development environment.</p>
<h1>Final notes</h1>
<aside class="right">
    I love apt, I love pip, why can't you?
</aside>

<p>I don't want to keep arguing about this. Just accept that the world's a big
place and that there exist use-cases that both <code>apt</code> and <code>pip</code> need to exist
and work in the way they're working now. At the very least, try and understand
there exist smart people on both sides, and no one is trying to screw anyone
over or keep their own little private club to themselves. Hopefully, going
forward, we can make sure that the integration between these two tools gets
<em>better</em>, not worse.</p>
<p>Help make this dream a reality. Contribute to a productive tone, not a
destructive one. In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>pip</code> without <code>sudo</code> always. Don't tell people to use <code>sudo</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>apt</code> or <code>dpkg</code> when deploying system-wide.</li>
<li>Understand people are going to package, and they will be more concerned
    about software using your library then keeping your library up to date.</li>
<li>Understand Debian Developers and package maintainers have to do a lot of
    work when updating or sponsoring an upload.</li>
<li>Understand upstream developers can't be bothered to fix every issue
    with every release (release early, release often) with some snapshot
    you introduced into unstable.</li>
<li>Use <code>pip</code> and <code>virtualenv</code> in development setups, so we can upgrade your
    app when we upgrade the lib.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unpopular Privacy, Arbitrary Justice, For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf, My Beloved World, The Sand Child.</p>
<p>The last 5 books! Putting me at 176. One got lost along the way, and I don&rsquo;t know where it went. Wrap up post is coming. Until then, this is a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/lynda-barry-the-20-stages-of-reading/2013/09/13/e82fd970-1cbf-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d_gallery.html#photo=1">pretty good summary</a>.<!-- more --></p>
<p>I saw Anita Allen speak at the Harvard Law Review&rsquo;s symposium on privacy last year, and bought her book soon after. It&rsquo;s taken me a while to read it because it&rsquo;s incredibly dense, and the beginning engages in the sort of philosophical navel-gazing that seems to infect all of the privacy folks since Brandeis. (How&rsquo;s that for a judgmental sentence?) Fortunately, the book improves substantially, and although the explanations and structure can be a little spotty, I think Allen focuses on a key concept - privacy as a way of thinking about what we as a society want to keep secret. This is especially relevant in her discussion of racial privacy and racial data collection, where the contrast between arguments for collection and arguments against is very stark. I might suggest that people read excerpts of this if they&rsquo;re interested in the topic, but quite frankly, the first couple chapters are ponderous to the extreme.</p>
<p>Arbitrary Justice was great. There was a reference to this in the New Jim Crow, and I think it does a great of job of discussing prosecutorial discretion from both an outcome and process perspective. It&rsquo;s also quite readable, not too dense, and impactful.</p>
<p>For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf is a stage play/choreopoem that combines spoken word poetry with a theatrical format. I liked just reading this book, and there were certainly moments in the text that took my breath away. Despite thatI think I would have enjoyed it more if I had actually seen a production of it. I also liked how the edition I read had lots of background information on the play and how it came to be - made reading it way more interesting. I can&rsquo;t believe Tyler Perry made a movie out of this though. </p>
<p>Sonia Sotomayor! My Beloved World! I read this book the day before Orientation started, just for maximum impact. Overall, I&rsquo;m not quite sure how I felt about it. I definitely enjoyed reading it - Justice Sotomayor is a great storyteller, and I love how her transition from a poor neighborhood/rough family life to Princeton is explained as to really impact readers who may have never had to think about the differences. However, I just walked away not feeling like I understood Justice Sotomayor much better as a person after reading the book, which is odd, since it&rsquo;s her memoir.</p>
<p>Final book: The Sand Child (thanks Ted for the recommendation). What a down note to end on. I love the concept of this book - it&rsquo;s about a woman in Morocco whose parents were desperate for a male child, so they raise her as a man. The premise is so great, but the book does not explore the gender identity issues very well, and towards the end, the storytelling style goes totally off the rails, making it very difficult to follow what&rsquo;s going on (even accepting that there are a bunch of different endings to the same story). I was so excited by the topic that I let my enthusiasms get in the way of my friend&rsquo;s cautions. Whoops.</p>

		<p>Week 36:</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/5532dff1bc501a4b55b691bf28864130/tumblr_inline_mstfffOR8R1qz4rgp.png" /></p>
<p>Damn, this may have been the best week of books yet! And it was just last week.<!-- more --></p>
<p>I love Baratunde Thurston, I think he&rsquo;s hilarious - but I was so-so on How To Be Black. It&rsquo;s certainly a fun, quick read, and I enjoyed the parts of his life story that he told and the advice he gave. One flaw is that the book jumps around, from advice on how to be a black friend to a history of Thurston&rsquo;s life at Sidwell Friends School and at Harvard, which can make it hard to keep track of his tone. </p>
<p>Pimp&rsquo;s Up, Ho&rsquo;s Down was a short book that discusses hip hop and feminism. Individual sections were quite good, although the writing was (as with How To Be Black) jumpy - switching from one topic to another without necessarily signaling very well or covering anything very fully. This book was helpful as an intro to some of the points that a feminist analysis can bring to hip hop culture, but felt quite incomplete.</p>
<p><span>bell hooks was on my agenda to read this summer: my only regret is I didn&rsquo;t get to her work, specifically Feminism is for Everyone, sooner. I loved this book. I think it speaks strongly against the claim that feminism is no longer necessary, and that hooks argues rather persuasively that feminism needs to be a broader radical structure in order to be successful. The most beautiful antidote to Lean In. </span></p>
<p>I found out about How to Suppress Women&rsquo;s Writing from an Ada Initiative <a href="http://www.kendraalbert.com/(http://adainitiative.org/2013/08/deleting-ada-lovelace-from-the-history-of-computing/">blogpost about Ada Lovelace</a>, and despite the fact that the book was published in the1970s, I was able to request a copy from my local library system (Cambridge Public Library for the win!). This book is utterly fascinating especially as I embark upon another adventure into schooling where I imagine that I&rsquo;ll primarily be exposed to old white dudes. </p>
<p>Joanna Russ uses each chapter to discuss a different method of suppressing women&rsquo;s writing, taking the tone of a guidebook. For example, she starts by suggesting the &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t write it…some man did&rdquo; tact. You can then move on to the slightly more advanced &ldquo;She wrote it, but she shouldn&rsquo;t have…it was too controversial,&rdquo; and then &ldquo;she wrote it, but look what she wrote about…she wrote about women and the family. Clearly meaningless,&rdquo; and so on and so forth. It&rsquo;s irreverent, biting and hilarious. Russ also does an excellent job dissecting how women&rsquo;s contributions to the literary canon stay at about 8% of anthologies, mostly because women writers need to be seen as truly exceptional to be included.  I wish this had been included in my high school English studies - it&rsquo;s a critical look at how canons are conventionally constructed, with a strong literary focus.</p>
<p>So The New Jim Crow is my new go-to non-fiction recommendation. I was totally blown away by how convincing Michelle Alexander&rsquo;s argument was. Basic summary: the current &ldquo;colorblind&rdquo; criminal justice system leads to MASSIVE inequality and a minority underclass of felons. Each step in the system (from searches to prosecutorial discretion in charging defendants to plea bargaining to parole to life upon release) creates additional imbalances between minorities accused of crimes and whites. I thought the title was a bit of exaggeration when I picked this up - and I was shocked to see how much I was wrong. The only flaw in this books is the focus on Barack Obama. I understand that Alexander was reacting against claims that the US was in a post-racism state due to the election of a black president, but it distracts from the main point of the text. </p>

<p>Women, Race and Class; Black Genius, Feminism Unmodified, Like Son, The Internet Police</p>
<p>The end of the vacation books! I&rsquo;m almost done blogging about reading! Woo!<!-- more --></p>
<p>It was entertaining to read the Internet Police, as everyone who saw me reading it thought that I was hate-reading it. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s more about police on the Internet than policing the Internet.  It&rsquo;s by Nate Anderson, who&rsquo;s an Ars Technica writer, and if you&rsquo;ve followed Ars&rsquo;s coverage, much of the book may be familiar, from RATs and webcam spying to how to set up an Internet sting. The book describes the technologies  at issue accurately and thoroughly without getting boring, and presents many of the problems of online law enforcement, from the Silk Road to child porn. Would recommend as an intro to cybercrime.</p>
<p>Like Son is by the same author as Trace Elements of Random Tea Parties, and like the last book, Felicia Luna Lemus immerses the reader in a slightly madcap yet vaguely realistic world. The main character is genderqueer/trans (it&rsquo;s not entirely clear from the narrative), and reacts to the death of his father by picking up his life and moving to New York. He also harbors an obsession with a 1940s Mexican poet - which expresses itself in an odd way. I liked this book a lot - I think Lemus really captures strange slices of life, and it&rsquo;s interesting to read about them. Sometimes the writing is a little choppy, or the characters over the top, but that&rsquo;s part of the fun.</p>
<p>Women, Race and Class is by Angela Y. Davis, a activist and scholar who may be most famous for her fight against prisons. It fills in many of the gaps in historical narratives about women, feminist activism, and the role of black women. I was shocked I didn&rsquo;t read anything like this in school - in a way, it&rsquo;s the flip side of the modern feminist narrative, and a necessary component in understanding the vital role of black women in early feminism and the experience of black women in early America.</p>
<p>Black Genius was a book I picked up randomly at Powell&rsquo;s - it was an interesting mix of essays from prominent black thinkers about how to address community problems. I enjoyed Spike Lee&rsquo;s and bell hooks&rsquo;s contributions to the collection, but found the works pretty disjointed, with not much tying them together (other than a lack of comfort with the phrase &ldquo;black genius&rdquo;). </p>
<p>Finally, Feminism Unmodified (thanks, Esther!). Wow. So I was blown away by this book - or at least, blown away by the first half. I found Catharine MacKinnon&rsquo;s arguments very compelling - she&rsquo;s speaking directly to many of the problem that second wave feminism faced, powerfully answering questions about how to consider women and the law. However, in the second half, she mostly talks about pornography, which I would not have put in the top spot as a feminist problem.</p>
<p>MacKinnon seems to firmly believe that much discrimination stems from pornography and pornographic depictions of women, and draws many conclusions from Linda Lovelace&rsquo;s story about being abused to produce Deepthroat. These essays were not very compelling - although I think that female performers in porn can be degraded, and there are certainly questions about the industry and its practices, I don&rsquo;t see this as a key focus for feminism, and I don&rsquo;t believe that porn is inherently misogynistic. This puts me pretty strongly at odds with MacKinnon, and though I admire the depths of her conviction, I think her stance on pornography/erotica lacks nuance and is too black and white. </p>

<p><span>Trace Elements of Random Tea Parties, My Homemade Life, Report from Planet Midnight, Passing, How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe</span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d call this a week of books that take you somewhere else. Greatly enjoyed visiting most of these locations, not sure I would want to live there.<!-- more --></p>
<p>Trace Elements of Random Tea Parties - I should start a subcategory of LA themed books (Southland, this, The Age of Dreaming). I loved how this book captures so much of a particular subculture (lesbians in LA in the 90s), and how it handles race, history and sexuality all in the entertaining (and sexy) main story. It&rsquo;s fun to read things that are vastly different from my experience of the world - would recommend if you want to be transported into a not too serious world of crazy hijinks and endless drama.</p>
<p>I loved A Homemade Life. It&rsquo;s a memoir, centered around food and cooking (much like a longer, non-graphic novel Relish), with recipes and sap and happy stories. The writer, Molly Wizenberg, has a fabulous <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/">food blog</a> and she&rsquo;s fun to read and has a great voice. </p>
<p>Report from Planet Midnight is a compilations (not a short story collection!) of works by Nalo Hopkinson, including an interview with her, a speech she gave at the International Conference on the Fantastic in the Art, and a riff on the Tempest. This was my first time with Nalo Hopkinson, and I loved it - her interview is fun, with great questions and even better answers, and the book ties together into a great meta-work about scifi.</p>
<p>Passing. Wow. It&rsquo;s from 1929 and it&rsquo;s an amazing short novel that centers on two women of mixed race who handle society and their lives in vastly different ways, with one of them using her light skin to pass as white. She doesn&rsquo;t even tell her husband that she is mixed, leading to tension between her and her friends, who don&rsquo;t attempt to pass. This book is fascinating and complex, but still has a tight plot and manages to come in under 150 pages. I wish I had read this in school at some point, but I didn&rsquo;t, and therefore I got to read it now!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure what to say about How To Live… It&rsquo;s choppy and hard to follow (but I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s on purpose), super weird and disjointed (but I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s on purpose) and just all around odd (that&rsquo;s definitely on purpose). I was pretty happy when it was over and I got to stop reading it. And that&rsquo;s pretty much all I have to say about it.</p>

<p>Liar&rsquo;s Poker, The Magicians, The Age of Dreaming, The Alchemist, Ash</p>
<p>Ugh, 5 books and none of them were really that good. <!-- more --></p>
<p>Another week, another book that is free from the Kindle Lending Library that talks about finance. I had enjoyed Boomerang and The Big Short, so figured I&rsquo;d return to Liar&rsquo;s Poker, where Michael Lewis first got his start. It&rsquo;s much more of a personal memoir and is not meant to teach high finance concepts. Originally written in the 80s, it&rsquo;s not going to tell a reader who picks it up now anything they didn&rsquo;t know about about Wall Street. At the time, the notion that traders were self-serving know - graduates of top schools might have been shocking, but now it&rsquo;s just par for the course.</p>
<p>The Magicians is a dark take on Harry Potter/Narnia. Given that, I was kind of expecting to love it but I didn&rsquo;t. Heavy on the navel gazing, with a utterly uncompelling main character. So many better books I could have read.</p>
<p>The Age of Dreaming is a historical fiction book about the silent film industry, from the perspective of a (fictional) Japanese film star. It&rsquo;s by the same author as Southland, and handles a lot of the same themes. The narrative style is a bit clunky, with lots of flashbacks to past times - it would have been more effective if the author had just told the story in the moment rather than attempting to set main story in present day. Worth a read if you&rsquo;re particularly interested in silent film, I guess.</p>
<p>The Alchemist - somehow I missed this book in high school. I read lots of Paulo Coelho, and I remember like Veronika Decides to Die much better than this. Super quick read, not particularly life changing (despite what the back cover says).</p>
<p>Ash is a lesbian retelling of Cinderella. It&rsquo;s not particularly well written - too many subplots, and too much going on, but I liked the ending, and enjoyed how the author played with the fair tale tropes.</p>

	<section>
		<p>One of my new favorite languages is a peppy little
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp">lisp</a> called
<a href="http://hylang.org">hy</a>. I like it a lot since it's a result of a hilarious
idea I had while talking with some coworkers over mexican food. Since I'm
the most experienced <a href="https://github.com/hylang?tab=members">Hypster</a> on the
planet, I figured I should write a survival guide. This will go a lot easier
if you already know Lisp, but you can get away with quite a bit of Python.</p>
<h1>The Tao of Hy</h1>
<p>We don't have many rules (yet), but we do have quite a bit of philosophy.
The collective Hyve Mind has spent quite a bit of time working out Hy's
internals, and we do spend a bit of time looking at how the language “feels”.
The following is a brief list of some of the design decisions we've
picked out.</p>
<ol>
<li>Look like a lisp, <code>DTRT</code> with it (e.g. dashes turn to underscores,
     earmuffs turn to all-caps.)</li>
<li>We're still Python. Most of the internals translate 1:1 to Python
     internals.</li>
<li>Use unicode <em>everywhere</em>.</li>
<li>Tests or it doesn't exist.</li>
<li>Fix the bad decisions in Python 2 when we can (see <code>true_division</code>)</li>
<li>When in doubt, defer to Python.</li>
<li>If you're still unsure, defer to Clojure</li>
<li>If you're even more unsure, defer to Common Lisp</li>
<li>Keep in mind we're <em>not</em> Clojure. We're <em>not</em> Common Lisp. We're Homoiconic
     Python, with extra bits that make sense.</li>
</ol>
<p>Naturally, this doesn't cover everything, but if you can drop into that mindset,
things start to make quite a bit of sense.</p>
<h1>The Style of Hy</h1>
<p>Although I am perhaps the least qualified person to do so (I still don't write
idiomatic Lisp all the time), I'm going to set up a few ground-rules when it
comes to idiomatic Hy code. We borrow quite a bit of syntax from Common Lisp
and Clojure, so again, feel free to defer to either if you're not working
on Hy internals. I prefer the
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide">Clojure Style Guidelines</a>
myself. As such, these are what we will defer to in the case that the Hy
style is undefined.</p>
<h2>Clojure-isms</h2>
<p>Hy has quite a few Clojure-isms that I rather prefer, such as the threading
macro, and dot-notation (for accessing methods on an Object), which I would
rather see used throught the hylands.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">;; good:</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">with</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">fd</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">open</span> <span class="s">&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;</span><span class="p">)]</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">print </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">.readlines</span> <span class="nv">fd</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="c1">;; bad:</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">with</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">fd</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">open</span> <span class="s">&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;</span><span class="p">)]</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">print </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">fd.readlines</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Some <a href="http://dustycloud.org/">other hy devs</a> very much disagree, and there's
nothing syntactically invalid about the latter, and it will continue to be
supported (in fact, it makes some things easier!), but it will not be
considered for Hy internal code.</p>
<p>We also very much encourage use of the <code>threading macro</code> throughout code
where it makes sense.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">;; good:</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">import </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">sh</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">cat</span> <span class="nv">grep</span><span class="p">]])</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">-&gt; </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">cat</span> <span class="s">&quot;/usr/share/dict/words&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">grep</span> <span class="s">&quot;-E&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;tag$&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="c1">;; bad:</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">import </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">sh</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">cat</span> <span class="nv">grep</span><span class="p">]])</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">grep</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">cat</span> <span class="s">&quot;/usr/share/dict/words&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">&quot;-E&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;tag$&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>However, do use it when it helps aid in clarity, like all things, there are
cases where it makes a mess out of something that ought to not be futzed with.</p>
<h2>Python-isms</h2>
<p>In addition to stealing quite a bit of syntax from Clojure, I'm going to
take a few Python rules from PEP8 that apply to Hy as well. These are taken
because PEP8 is a really great set of rules, and Hy code ends up pretty,
well, Pythonic. The following are a collection of Pythonic rules that
explicitly apply to Hy code.</p>
<p>Trailing spaces is a huge one. Never ever ever shall it be OK to have
trailing spaces on internal Hy code. For they suck.</p>
<p>As with Python, you shall always double-space module-level definitions if
separated with a newline.</p>
<p>All public functions must always contain docstrings.</p>
<p>Inline comments shall be <em>two</em> spaces from the end of the code, if they
are inline comments. They must always have a space between the comment
character and the start of the comment.</p>
<h2>Hy-isms</h2>
<p>Indentation shall be two spaces, except where matching the indentation
of the previous line.</p>

<p>Don't use S-Expression syntax where vector syntax is really required. For
instance, the fact that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">;; bad (and evil)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">foo</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">print </span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">foo</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>works is just because the compiler isn't overly strict. In reality, the
correct syntax in places such as this is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">;; good (and preferred):</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">defn </span><span class="nv">foo</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">print </span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">foo</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<h1>Notice</h1>
<p>This guide is, above all, a <em>guide</em>. This is also only truely binding
for working on Hy code internally. This post is also super subject to change
in the future, whenever I can be bothered to ensure that we have more of the
de facto rules written down.</p>

In last week's NYT Sunday Review section (which I normally read only semi-closely), I caught this telling correction:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Public Editor's column last Sunday misstated the nature of the killing of Trayvon Martin. It should have been referred to as a shooting, not a crime.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I also happened on <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/a-bottle-of-water-in-brazzaville/">this article</a> by Laird Hunt, whom I "studied" with at Naropa University (attended lectures and readings by him). The paper version of this was much different (shorter) than the online version; it's an interesting story. Mainly I love the idea of anyone who taught at Naropa appearing in the pages of the <cite>New York Times</cite>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anselm_Hollo">Anselm</a> would be proud. I still have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1566891442/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1566891442&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wjsullivannet-20">Indiana, Indiana</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wjsullivannet-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1566891442" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> sitting on my shelf waiting to be read.

	<section>
		<p>Over my time working with Debian packages, I've always been concerned that
I have been missing catchable mistakes by not running all the static checking
tools I could run. As a result, I've been interested in writing some code that
automates this process, a place where I can push a package and come back a few
hours later to check on the results. This is great, since it provides a slightly
less scary interface to new packagers, and helps avoid thinking they've
just been “told off” by a Developer.</p>
<p>I've spent the time to actually write this code, and I've called it
<a href="http://debuild.me">debuild.me</a>. The code itself is in its fourth
iteration, and is built up from a few core components. The client / server code
(<a href="http://github.com/paultag/lucy">lucy</a> and
<a href="http://github.com/paultag/ethel">ethel</a>) are quite interconnected, but
<a href="https://github.com/fedora-static-analysis/firehose">firehose</a> works great
on its own, and is a single, unified (and sane!) spec that is easy
to hack with (or even on!). Hopefully, this means that our wrappers will be
usable outside of debuild.me, which is a win for everyone.</p>
<h1>Backend Design</h1>
<p>The backend (<a href="http://github.com/paultag/lucy">lucy</a>) was the first part
I wanted to design. I made the decision (very early on) that everything was
going to be 100% Python 3.3+. This lets me use some of the (frankly, sweet)
tools in the stdlib. Since I've written this type of thing before
(I've tried to write this tool <a href="https://github.com/paultag/monomoy-old">many</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/paultag/monomoy">many</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/paultag/chatham-old">many</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/paultag/chatham">many</a> times before), so I had a rough
sense of how I wanted to design the backend. Past iterations had suffered from
an overly complex server half, so I decided to go ultra minimal with the
design of debuild.me.</p>
<aside class="left">
  You can find the code for the server (lucy) on
  <a href="http://github.com/paultag/lucy">my GitHub</a>
</aside>

<p>The backend watches a directory (using a simple <code>inotify</code> script) and processes
<code>.changes</code> files as they come in. If the package is a source package, a set of
jobs are triggered (such as <code>lintian</code>, <code>build</code> and <code>desktop-file-validate</code>),
as well as a different set for binary packages (such as <code>lintian</code>, <code>piuparts</code>
and <code>adequite</code>).  Only people may upload source packages (without any debs) and
only builders can upload binary packages (without source).</p>
<p>The client and server talk using
<a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.server.html">XML-RPC</a> with BASIC HTTP
auth. I'm going to (eventually) SSL secure the transport layer, but for now,
this will work as a proof of concept.</p>
<p>Since I tend to like to keep my codebase simple and straightforward, I've used
<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> as Lucy's DB. This lets me move between
documents in Mongo to Python objects without any trouble. In addition, I
evaluated some of the queue code out there (ZMQ, etc), and they all seemed
like overkill for my problem, and had a hard time keeping track of jobs that
(must never!) get lost. As a result, I wrote my own (very simple) job queue
in Mongo, which has no sense of scheduling (at all), but can do its job (and
do it well).</p>
<p>Jobs describe what's to be built with a link to the <code>package</code> document
that the job relates to, and its <code>arch</code> and <code>suite</code> (don't worry about the
rest just yet). Jobs get assigned via natural sort on its <code>UUID</code> based <code>_id</code>,
and assigned to the first builder that can process its <code>arch</code> / <code>suite</code>.
Source packages are considered <code>arch:all</code> / <code>suite:unstable</code> (so they always
get the most up-to-date linters on any arch that comes along).</p>
<p>Lucy also allows for uploads to be given an <code>X-Lucy-Group</code> tag to manage which
set of packages they're a part of. This comes in handy for doing partial
archive rebuilds, or eventually using it to manage what jobs should be run
on which uploads. This will allow me to run much more time-consuming tools
for packages I want to review versus rebuilding to ensure packages don't
FTBFS or aren't adequite.</p>
<h1>Client Design</h1>
<p>The buildd client (<a href="http://github.com/paultag/ethel">ethel</a>) talks with <code>lucy</code>
via <code>XML-RPC</code> to get assigned new jobs, release old jobs, close finished jobs,
and upload package report data. When the <code>etheld</code> requests a new job, it also
passes along what <code>suites</code> it knows of, which <code>arches</code> it can build, as well
as what <code>types</code> it can run (stuff like <code>lintian</code>, <code>build</code> or <code>cppcheck</code>.) Lucy
then assigns the builder to that job (so that we don't allocate the same job
twice), and what time it was assigned at.</p>
<aside class="right">
  You can find the code for the client (ethel) on
  <a href="http://github.com/paultag/ethel">my GitHub</a>
</aside>

<p>Ethel then takes the result of the job (in the form of a <code>firehose.model</code> tree)
and transmits it over the line back to the Lucy server as a <code>report</code> (which also
contains information on if the build failed or not), at which point
lucy hands back a location (on the lucy host) that the daemon can write the log
to.</p>
<p>If the job was a binary build, the <code>etheld</code> process will <code>dput</code> the package to
the server, with a special <code>X-Lucy-Job</code> tag to signal which job that build
relates to, so that future lint runs can fetch the <code>deb</code> files that the build
produced.</p>
<h1>Tooling</h1>
<p>Ethel runs a set of static checkers on the source code, which are basically
fancy wrappers around the tools we all know and love (like
<a href="http://lintian.debian.org/">lintian</a>,
<a href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/desktop-file-utils/">desktop-file-validate</a>,
or <a href="http://piuparts.debian.org/">piuparts</a>) which output Firehose in place of
home-grown stdout. This allows us to programmatically deal with the output
of these tools in a normal and consistent way.</p>
<aside class="left">
  You can read more about Firehose over in the Firehose
  <a href="https://github.com/fedora-static-analysis/firehose/blob/master/README.rst">README.rst</a>
</aside>

<p>Some of the more complex runners are made of 3 parts - a <code>runner</code>, <code>wrapper</code>
and <code>command</code>. The server invokes the <code>command</code> routine, which invokes the
<code>runner</code> (the command just provides a unified interface to all the runners),
who's output gets parsed by the <code>wrapper</code> to turn it into a Firehose model
tree.</p>
<p>The goal here is that tons of very quick-running tools get run over a
distributed network, and machine-readable reports get filed in a central
location to aid in reviewing packages.</p>
<h1>Ricky</h1>
<p>In addition to the actual code to run builds, I've worked on a few tools to
aid with using debuild.me for my DD related life. I have some uncommon
use-cases that are nice to support. One such use-case is the ability to rebuild
packages from the archive (unmodified) to check that they rebuild OK against
the target. This is handy for things like <code>arch:all</code> packages that get
uploaded (since they never get rebuilt on the buildd machines, and FTBFSs are
sadly common) or packages that have had a <code>Build-Dependency</code> change on them.</p>
<p>Ricky is able to create a <code>.dsc</code> url to your friendly local mirror, and fetch
that exact version of the package. Ricky can then also use the <code>.dsc</code> (in a
monumental hack) to forge a <code>package_version_source.changes</code> file, and sign
it with an autobuild key and upload it to the debuild.me instance. Since it
can also modify the <code>.changes</code>'s target distribution, you can also use this to
test if a package will build on <code>stable</code> or <code>testing</code>, unmodified.</p>
<h1>Fred</h1>
<p>Fred is a wrapper around Ricky, to help with fetching packages that may not
exist yet. Fred also contains an email scraper to read off such lists as
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes">debian-devel-changes</a>, and
add an entry to fetch that upload when it becomes available on the local
mirror, pass it to <code>ricky</code>, and allow debuild.me to rebuild new packages
that match a set of criteria.</p>
<p>I'm currently playing around with the idea of rebuilding all incoming
Python packages to ensure they don't FTBFS in a clean chroot.</p>
<h1>Loofah</h1>
<p>Loofah is also another wrapper around Ricky, but for use manually. Loofah
is able to sync down the apt <code>Sources</code> list, and place it in Mongo for fast
queries. This than allows me to manually run rebuilds on any Source package
that fits a set of critera (written in the form of a Mongo query), which get
pulled and uploaded by <code>Ricky</code>.</p>
<p>An example script to rebuild any packages that <code>Build-Depend</code> on
<code>python3-all-dev</code> in Debian <code>unstable</code> / <code>main</code> would look like:</p>
<aside class="right">
    You can find more queries in the Loofah
    <a href="https://github.com/paultag/loofah/tree/master/eg">examples</a>
</aside>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nt">&quot;version&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;unstable&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nt">&quot;suite&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;main&quot;</span> <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nt">&quot;Build-Depends&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;python3-all-dev&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Or, a script to rebuild any package that depends on CDBS:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="p">{},</span>
    <span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;$or&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="nt">&quot;Build-Depends&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;cdbs&quot;</span><span class="p">},</span>
             <span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">&quot;Build-Depends-Indep&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;cdbs&quot;</span><span class="p">}]}</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You can use anything that exists in the <code>Sources.gz</code> file to query off of (
including <code>Maintainer</code>!)</p>
<h1>Future Work</h1>
<p>The future work on debuild.me will be centered around making it easier for
buildd nodes to be added to the network, with more and more automation in that
process (likely in the form of debs). I also want to add better control over
the jobs, so that packages I upload only go to my personal servers.</p>
<p>I'd also very much like to get better EC2 / Virtualization support integrated
into the network, so that the buildd count grows with the queue size. This
is a slightly hard problem that I'm keen to fix.</p>
<p>I'm also considering moving the log parsing code <em>out</em> of the workers, so that
the parsing code can be fixed without upgrading all the workers. This would also
drop the <code>Firehose</code> dep on the client code, which would be nice.</p>
<p>Migration from a debuild.me build into a local <code>reprepro</code> repo is something
that would be fairly easy to do as well, likely to be done remotely via
the <code>XML-RPC</code> interface, which calls a couple of <code>reprepro</code> commands (such as
<code>includedsc</code> and <code>includedeb</code>) and publishes it to the user's repo. This is
a nice use of the debs that get built, and could also allow debuild.me to be
used like a PPA system, but this allows the user to <em>not</em> migrate packages
that may contain <code>piuparts</code> issues.</p>

	<h1>2013-02-24 02:04:00: <a href="http://notes.pault.ag/apt-mirror">A primer on apt&#39;s mirror:// protocol</a> by paultag via <a href="http://notes.pault.ag/">Paul Tagliamonte</a></h1>
	<section>
		<p>It's sometimes helpful to keep your machines using a list of apt archives
to use, rather then a single mirror, because redudency is good. Rather then
using (the great) services like <code>http.debian.net</code> or <code>ftp.us.debian.org</code>,
you can set your own mirror lists using apt's <code>mirror://</code> protocol.</p>
<aside class="right">
    While initially hacking this through, Micah ended up
    filing a bug on <code>mirror://</code>, more information in
    <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/699310">the bts</a>. I've since been
    able to get it to work for me, but beware!
</aside>

<p>All of this is ultra unstable, so be a bit careful when using this. I've been
using <code>mirror://</code> for a few months now, and it seems fine (even have my servers
using it), but it was a bit of a pain to set up. It gets slightly confused if
you point it at something bad, and it's a mild pain to debug. Hopefully
more people will see the value in <code>mirror://</code>, and contribute code to it's
development.</p>
<h1>Why bother?</h1>
<p>If you have a local network mirror, it's helpful to have your machines default
to a local mirror, if you're the sort to keep an archive mirror on the LAN,
and fall back to your nearest friendly mirror otherwise. In addition,
this lets you hand-define where apt searches for mirrors, which is great, since
you can control the subset of servers you ping a bit more closely.</p>
<h1>Practical Bits / quickstart</h1>
<p>The following block covers the quick and dirty details on how to set up
<code>mirror://</code> for use on your machine (today!). This is very basic, and
details are very sparse, but hopefully there's enough here to help folks
use this on their local system. Basically, you've got three core things to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick your mirrors (this one's a bit of a duh)</li>
<li>Put them in a public place you can always get to, regardless of
     where you are in cyberspace (I use
     <a href="http://static.pault.ag/debian/mirrors.txt">static.pault.ag</a>) - remember,
     this is the one thing all your machines need to always get to, no matter
     where they are.</li>
<li>Configure your <code>sources.list</code> to use the mirror.txt file by pointing
     to the text file with the <code>mirror://</code> protocol.</li>
</ol>
<p>Turns out <code>mirror://</code>'s protocol handler will segfault if you give it
something bad, so don't be afraid if you see <code>apt-get update</code> segfault - it
just means you've likely not pointed it at a valid text file. The format of
the text file should be a simple text file of mirrors it can try, in
order of priority. Mine looks a bit like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>http://127.0.0.1:3142/debian.lcs.mit.edu/debian/
http://debian.lcs.mit.edu/debian/
# http://http.debian.net/debian/
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, your <code>sources.list</code> entry should look a bit like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">deb</span> <span class="s">mirror://static.pault.ag/debian/mirrors.txt</span> <span class="kp">unstable</span> <span class="kp">main</span>
<span class="k">deb</span> <span class="s">mirror://static.pault.ag/debian/mirrors.txt</span> <span class="kp">experimental</span> <span class="kp">main</span>
<span class="k">deb-src</span> <span class="s">mirror://static.pault.ag/debian/mirrors.txt</span> <span class="kp">unstable</span> <span class="kp">main</span>
<span class="k">deb-src</span> <span class="s">mirror://static.pault.ag/debian/mirrors.txt</span> <span class="kp">experimental</span> <span class="kp">main</span>
</pre></div>


<h1>Problems</h1>
<p>With the good comes the bad. Not everything fully supports this, and most
tools that parse <code>sources.list</code> break in a really silly way.</p>
<h2>command-not-found</h2>
<p><code>update-command-not-found</code> will blow up like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>W: Don't know how to handle mirror
W: Don't know how to handle mirror
W: Don't know how to handle mirror
W: Don't know how to handle mirror
W: Don't know how to handle mirror

	<section>
		<p>Some of you out there may have tried to pass flags to a script that was being
invoked via <code>/usr/bin/env</code> in the shebang (<code>#!</code>), such as <code>python</code>. You might
recall an error such as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>/usr/bin/env: python -d: No such file or directory
</pre></div>


<p>This error is super annoying, so I went about trying to figure out how
I can pass arguments to <code>python</code> (or even things like <code>ipython</code> or <code>bpython</code>).</p>
<p>The idea is we can abuse the concept of a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_(computing)">polygot</a> to shim in some
things we care about.</p>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>Let's take a look at a quick script I hacked up to use bpython with a pre-made
script that drops into interactive work.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>#!/bin/sh
&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;:
exec /usr/bin/env bpython -i $0 $@
&quot;&quot;&quot;
import hy
print &quot;Hython is now importable!&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Let's step through this slowly. First, the bits the <code>bash</code> sees:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span>
<span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>:
<span class="nb">exec</span> /usr/bin/env bpython -i <span class="nv">$0</span> <span class="nv">$@</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Which will cause <code>bpython</code> to reload the file, which looks like the following
to Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span>
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;:</span>
<span class="sd">exec /usr/bin/env bpython -i $0 $@</span>
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">hy</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hython is now importable!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Where Python can now ignore the docstring. Magic!</p>
